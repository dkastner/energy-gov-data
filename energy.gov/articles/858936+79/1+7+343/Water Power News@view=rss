 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy announced its selection for a fully permitted, grid-connected national wave energy test site in December, and the marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy sector has been buzzing ever since. The facility will be constructed in Newport, Oregon, by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center at Oregon State University and will support innovations in wave energy technologies capable of harnessing the significant wave energy resources along U.S. coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Self-charging Tracking Device Monitors Fish Migration through Hydroelectric Dams </title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/self-charging-tracking-device-monitors-fish-migration-through-hydroelectric-dams</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to understand how fish swim through rivers, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed an injectable tracking device, known as an acoustic fish tag, with a self-charging battery. Funded by the Energy Department, this project is part of a long-term mission to contribute valuable research on fish migration through waterways when encountering hydroelectric dams. The key purpose of the study is to see whether or not fish become injured or hindered by the presence of hydroelectric devices.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
