Under the Department of Energy's Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program, these states will implement programs that lower energy use, reduce carbon pollution, and create green jobs locally.</p>
<p>"This funding will allow states across the country to make major investments in energy solutions that will strengthen America's economy and create jobs at the local level," said Secretary Chu. "It will also promote some of the cheapest, cleanest and most reliable energy technologies we have - energy efficiency and conservation - which can be deployed immediately. Local communities can now make strategic investments to help meet the nation's long term clean energy and climate goals."</p>
<p>States receiving funding today include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Today's awards to the State Energy Offices will be used to support state-level energy efficiency priorities, along with funding local conservation projects in smaller cities and counties.  At least 60 percent of each state's award will be passed through to local cities and counties not eligible for direct EECBG awards from the Department of Energy.  The EECBG Program was funded for the first time by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and provides formula grants to states, cities, counties, territories and federally-recognized Indian tribes nationwide to implement energy efficiency projects locally. </p>
<p>Energy efficiency and conservation projects that are eligible for awards include the development of an energy efficiency and conservation strategy, energy efficiency audits and retrofits, transportation programs, the creation of financial incentive programs for energy efficiency improvements, the development and implementation of advanced building codes and inspections, and installation of renewable energy technologies on municipal buildings.</p>
<p>Transparency and accountability are important priorities for the EECBG program and all Recovery Act projects. All grantees have specific measures they must take before spending the full amount of awarded funding, such as ensuring oversight and transparency, submitting a conservation strategy to the Department of Energy, and complying with environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Throughout the program's implementation, DOE will provide strong oversight at the local, state, and tribal level, while emphasizing the need to quickly award funds to help create new jobs and stimulate local economies. Communities will be required to report regularly to DOE on the progress they have made toward successfully completing projects and reaching program goals.</p>
<p>For a full list of awards to date, visit <a href="http://www.eecbg.energy.gov">www.eecbg.energy.gov</a>.<br /> <br />The following states are receiving their state-level EECBG awards today:</p>

Sixty percent of the funds Nebraska receives today will be passed along to local governments.  Nearly 583 cities and counties will be eligible to apply for these subgrants, and awardees will be selected through a competitive process.  Priority will be given to projects that meet the identified energy efficiency needs of the state's 83 counties and nearly 500 towns eligible for grants and will maximize benefits statewide.</p>
<p><strong>NEW HAMPSHIRE - $9,593,500 awarded today</strong><br />New Hampshire will use its Recovery Act EECBG funding to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption and associated costs within municipalities.  This will save or create more than 100 green jobs, while increasing market activity to facilitate economic sustainability and community well-being.  Seventy percent of the funds New Hampshire receives will be competitively awarded to cities and counties for a variety of activities including financial incentive mechanisms, building retrofits, energy audits, and transportation programs. Recovery Act funds will also be used to inventory municipalities' energy use and help communities create a road map process toward increased energy efficiency and decreased energy use and fossil fuel emissions.  These road map processes will involve the basic education of energy planning principles and processes, community forums to evaluate needs and priorities, assessment of community capacity, and financial planning for future grants, projects, and initiatives.  New Hampshire's remaining funds will be used for conducting program workshops and ensuring accountability with all state and federal requirements. </p>
<p><strong>NEW YORK - $29,760,600 awarded today</strong><br />New York will use its Recovery Act funds to contribute to the State's goal of meeting 45 percent of its electricity needs through improved energy efficiency and renewable energy by 2015.  Projects will address local priorities by reducing energy costs, improving building efficiency and transportation systems, and incorporating renewable energy into waste management practices.  It is anticipated that these projects will create hundreds of jobs statewide.  Ninety percent of New York's funds will be competitively awarded using a process that equitably distributes funding to approximately ten regions across the state.  Applications will be selected based on several factors including projected energy savings, greenhouse gas emission reduction, ability to implement projects expeditiously and participation in national and state programs focused on energy efficiency and green practices. The state's remaining funds will be used to support the promotion and adoption of more stringent energy codes for buildings in New York State, and various implementation and support services to local communities responsible for assuring compliance and administrative costs. </p>
<p><strong>RHODE ISLAND - $9,593,500 awarded today </strong><br />Rhode Island will use its Recovery Act EECBG funding to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of renewable energy, which is estimated to save or create hundreds of green jobs.  The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources (OER) will create three funding pools to advance these goals. First, a Base Grant Program will use $5,386,075 to ensure an equitable, per capita distribution of funds to all of the state's thirty-nine cities and towns regardless of whether or not they received a direct allocation from DOE. Second, a Competitive Grant Initiative will encourage communities large and small to compete for energy-efficiency grants totaling $3,155,226. Finally, Energy Performance Contracting Incentive Grants will leverage $885,679 with private funds in order to provide up-front financing for retrofits that will be carried out by energy service companies (ESCOs).  This part of the state's EECBG program is expected to deliver the greatest decreases in energy use and the largest increases in energy efficiency, energy conservation and cost savings.</p>
<p><strong>TEXAS - $45,638,100 awarded today</strong><br />The State of Texas is receiving Recovery Act EECBG funding to reduce fossil fuel emissions, decrease overall energy use, and improve energy efficiency statewide. These funds will be administered by the Texas State Energy Commission Office (SECO), which will redistribute the majority the state's funds by population-based formula grants to the approximately 1,130 cities and 244 counties in Texas that did not receive direct EECBG funds from DOE. SECO will encourage localities applying for funds to utilize proven energy conservation measures that can be undertaken quickly and have a favorable return on investment. As part of the effort to maximize the impact and longevity of the Recovery Act funds received, SECO is working with private entities and investors to identify financial incentives that cities and counties can use to match money from the EECBG program. In addition, SECO, in partnership with the Texas Historical Commission, is also using EECBG funds to retrofit county courthouses and other buildings with energy efficiency and conservation measures. Projects undertaken with these Recovery Act dollars are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 2,850,998 tons of CO2 annually, while creating hundreds of new green jobs within the state.</p>
<p><strong>WASHINGTON STATE - $10,645,900 awarded today</strong><br />Washington will use its EECBG Recovery Act funding to establish and support a competitive subgrant program for the implementation of greater energy efficiency measures statewide. The funds, to be administered by Washington's Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development (CDET), will enable localities to better meet one of the most stringent energy codes in the nation. CDET will distribute more than $6 million of the state's EECBG funding to local cities and counties with populations of less than 35,000 and 200,000 respectively. Grants will be awarded to recipients demonstrating feasible reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, longevity of activity benefits beyond the EECBG funding period, and at least a one-to-one ration for leveraged funds through public and private partnerships or other funding sources. The balance of the EECBG funding will be used for technical assistance and administering the program. The state will create an Energy Planning Program that will enable cities and counties to perform energy efficiency and conservation planning. In addition, the state will designate Resource Conservation Managers (RCM) to support the speedy implementation and overall progress of the Recovery Act-funded energy efficiency measures. The RCMs will provide oversight and accountability, ensuring that funds are being used for their appropriate designations. Successful implementation of Washington State's program will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, while creating hundreds of jobs statewide.</p>
<p><strong>WISCONSIN - $11,743,000 awarded today</strong><br />Wisconsin will use its Recovery Act EECBG funding to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of renewable energy across the state's economic sectors.  These projects will lead to substantial energy and cost savings, and create or retain jobs statewide.  All of the funds Wisconsin receives today will be distributed to cities and counties not eligible for direct DOE funding through the EECBG program. Local governments will be selected through a competitive process, which will favor highly-leveraged projects and regional collaboration.  As part of the process in awarding funding to local cities and counties, the state will develop information and application materials, conduct workshops explaining the program and application process, use teams with appropriate expertise to review and select applications, and monitor the funding throughout the program. Funds will primarily go to providing energy efficiency retrofits, energy efficiency and conservation programs for buildings and facilities, and installing energy efficient lighting.  Funds also will be used to develop outreach and education efforts to the general public.</p>
<p><strong>WYOMING - $9,593,500 awarded today</strong><br />Wyoming will use its Recovery Act EECBG funding to increase energy conservation and efficiency at the local level.  A primary focus of this funding will be to retrofit existing buildings to the latest efficiency standards of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Wyoming estimates that these improvements will lead to substantial energy and cost savings, and create or retain nearly 100 jobs statewide. The Wyoming State Energy Office will set aside $5,756,100 for smaller cities and counties to implement a wide variety of projects, including municipal, residential, and commercial energy audits, building efficiency retrofits, street lighting and traffic signal upgrades, and establishing and enforcing advanced building codes. Of the remaining funds, $3,187,400 will be made available for all eligible applicants, including those cities and counties receiving a direct allocation, non-profit organizations, joint powers boards, special districts and Tribal entities. Projects under these awards will be limited to energy efficiency retrofits of existing buildings.</p>
