<p>Well thank you, Admiral Harley, it’s really a pleasure to be here. Some of you know – I know at least one fellow graduate of Durfee High School in Fall River knows that I’m from Fall River, so not very far away from here. It’s an honor and a pleasure to be here at this esteemed, legendary Naval War College.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Congressman Jim Cooper – Jim is where, oh, there he is – for coming up and joining us here. Congressman Cooper is the Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee – a very serious student of these issues. We’ve had much time together including quite recently down in Tennessee.</p>
<p>I also want to thank my two colleagues and friends, Admiral John Richardson, the CNO, and Frank Caldwell, who is heading Naval Reactors.</p>
<p>I think this audience is quite aware that Naval Reactors is a shared activity of the Department of Energy and the Navy. We really like propelling you around and under the ocean, and John Richardson was the head of Naval Reactors. I was just telling Admiral Harley that when he became CNO, Ray Mabus and I had to figure out how to fire him from that job because it had never been done before, but we did it, and we did it ceremoniously in my office when he and Frank arrived.</p>
<p>But I want to say that move from Naval Reactors to CNO is something that we thought – I didn’t like losing John from that job, but I thought it was a great statement of the importance of the nuclear Navy in terms of that move to CNO. He also promised that we would get a terrific replacement, and we did, and that’s Frank Caldwell.</p>
<p>So the Department of Energy could not be more pleased with our collaboration, and I’ll say more about it, with the Navy, and with the Department of Defense overall. In fact, in late November, I was really pleased to receive the Distinguished Public Service Award from Secretary Ash Carter because of the overall interactions with DOD, but then about a week later, Secretary Mabus called, and he said “That was nice, the DOD award,” but he was now going to give me the “real one,” the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award. And if you look, those are the colors of this rosette, so I’m very pleased to do that, but we have a terrific relationship, including with Secretary Mabus.</p>
<p>In fact, our collaborations are really multifaceted. We do a lot of work on energy – certainly Secretary Mabus has brought a strong focus on moving towards what you might call naval energy independence, so we collaborate in developing future drop-in biofuels that could be used to displace petroleum-based fuels. We worked with the Navy to commission a 150-megawatt solar project in Arizona to provide one-third of the power to 14 Navy and Marine installations in California. Our National Renewable Energy Laboratory has worked closely with installations in Hawaii and Guam to increase the efficiency of those bases.</p>
<p>We also – a lot of this work in terms of clean energy underpins our work more generally on climate change, and I’d say again we emphasize strongly the national security implications of climate change – and that, in fact, has been emphasized by the Center for Naval Analyses now for quite some time, starting already in 2007 and more recently in 2015, making a clear connection between the risks that can be faced through climate change and the kinds of dislocations that can occur around the world, which ends up weighing on our military and their responsibility. So that’s another area of collaboration. As an aside, I might say, I’m not saying this is a firm association, but there certainly is a lot of discussion about how environmental dislocation in some sense was at the start of some of the troubles in Syria, which obviously affect us quite strongly.</p>
<p>Now nuclear propulsion is again a very clear area of collaboration, which we’ve already said, and I was very pleased with Admiral Caldwell, in fact, who visited Newport News to see the not-quite-on-the-water Ford Class aircraft carrier, with its spiffy new powerful nuclear reactors, and that’s going to be a real milestone when that gets on the water not too long from now – really terrific.</p>
<p>We’re also working of course together in terms of the next beyond Ohio Class submarines, in terms of getting that out effective in another roughly 15 years or so, replacing the Ohio Class. And again, with Admiral Caldwell, we were able to go up to our laboratory in Idaho and to see the advanced test reactor, which of course is a key facility for the Navy.</p>
<p>And finally, another area of collaboration, and now getting into the subject really of today’s discussion, is the deterrent – the nuclear deterrent. We are well along in extending the life of the W76, obviously a workhorse for the Navy in particular, as well as a major alteration of W88.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot going on, and again many – certainly in the public – do not recognize this very very strong and critical collaboration between Energy and Defense and Energy and Navy, and that’s certainly one reason why I’m so pleased to come here as we approach the end of the Administration and summarize, I think, some of the critical issues around nuclear security.</p>
<p>I might have added one more thing, actually, in terms of collaboration, and that is more broadly within the Department of Defense – and we can’t discuss it in too much detail – but our laboratories are also very engaged across the board, actually with Defense, with the intelligence community, with Homeland Security, in terms of using our technology assets in our laboratories for critical mission contributions to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Now Naval War College was founded in the words of Rear Admiral Luce, as “a place of original research on all questions relating to war and to statesmanship connected with war, or the prevention of war.”  And nuclear strategy certainly calls for statesmanship in exactly this tradition – and I have to say that one reason why I’m so pleased to be here to talk with you about these issues is that we are seeing a lot more discussion these days about nuclear security issues, some of it well-placed. I’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>So today I’d kind of like to go over some of that agenda and what I think are some of the essential issues that we need to address and we need to, frankly, stay the course on.</p>
<p>In terms of nuclear strategy, President Obama, as I’m sure you know, set out a pretty comprehensive vision very early in his term – just a couple months into his term – in Prague, the so-called Prague Agenda. The world has seen many events since that time – it certainly merits a relook at a number of those issues.</p>
<p>The Prague Agenda has not proved to be quite as linear as might have been thought in 2009, but I want to say right up front that it remains – at its core – the right agenda. It describes a desirable end state – which we know is far in the future in terms of a world ideally without nuclear weapons, certainly with nuclear weapons not posing the kind of threat we are seeing today, to which we will return.</p>
<p>He also made clear that as long as we have nuclear weapons – and that’s going to be a while, for sure – that we have to maintain that deterrent as safe, secure, and effective as an underpinning of how we defend ourselves and our allies.</p>
<p>Moving towards that end state, there are really two major directions that we need to discuss, and we will. One is kind of the nonproliferation international nuclear security, it’s minimizing the danger in the nuclear sphere, and the other is the nuclear deterrent and strategic stability.</p>
<p>Let me start with some discussion on the nonproliferation agenda, keeping nuclear weapons, improvised nuclear devices, nuclear materials, out of the wrong hands. We need to control or eliminate those materials.</p>
<p>Certainly the reach of international terrorism is greater, and we know today that the reticence in using nuclear weapons which nation states may have been exercising would not be the case should these materials or explosives fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>Now, we’ve made a lot of progress in these terms, on both nuclear and radiological threat reduction. The President’s Nuclear Summit – Nuclear Security Summit process really helped crystalize this. We have eliminated highly enriched uranium and plutonium from many countries and many entire regions of the world.</p>
<p>We’ve had progress in terms of the very important Iran Agreement, in terms of addressing their possible nuclear weapons program. I’d like to say a few words on that. Again, this is one of the areas that is getting a lot of discussion. We should understand what the Iran Agreement is, and what it is not.</p>
<p>What it is – by design – is an agreement focused on the existential question of a potential nuclear weapon in Iran. It is not an agreement about many other aspects of Iranian activity that we are extremely unhappy about, whether it’s support of terrorism, Hezbollah, Hamas, their activities, Syria, Yemen, activities around human rights, missile issues. I want to make it very clear: We have in no way diminished or reduced our concern about that – if anything, I think we have picked up the pressure on many of these issues.</p>
<p>But just as Ronald Reagan – when we had many, many challenges with the Soviet Union – negotiated arms control agreements, it was about reducing this nuclear danger. That’s what it is about, that’s what it should be judged about.</p>
<p>And, in that same vein, the only sanctions that have been lifted are the nuclear sanctions. And that, in fact, underpins some of the reason why you hear Iran stating that we’re the ones not implementing the agreement. It’s not true, but there are still many sanctions associated with other activity, and that is giving the international business and banking sectors pause in terms of their commitments. They are seeing economic benefits, but just not at the pace at which they had perhaps projected.</p>
<p>But the deal has been verified now for one year, and Monday, by the way, will be the one-year anniversary of implementation. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently stated that Iran is adhering to the agreement.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize what the agreement is. It has two components, and these are the red lines, fundamentally, that we had as negotiators in terms of reaching the agreement. Guidelines from the President.</p>
<p>One is that for some significant amount of time, there would be significant restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities. And that has been translated into a so-called “breakout time” conservatively reaching at least one year to give plenty of time for reaction should we find Iran not complying with the agreement. There are significant restrictions on their program for 15 years.</p>
<p>But what is absolutely critical is that it’s complemented by a unique verification regime, and that is indefinite in many of its features. It includes new features, for example, uranium supply chain visibility, transparency, monitoring, for 25 years – that’s an example, there are many, many other restrictions of this type.</p>
<p>In my view, personal view, frankly it would be terrific to see many of the verification measures in this Iran Agreement extended more broadly to the IAEA’s program. For example, the additional protocol to the nonproliferation – to the safeguards agreements with the IAEA call for inspection of undeclared sites that are suspicious. But the trouble is, except now in the Iran Agreement, there’s no timeframe for granting that access.</p>
<p>So that’s an example of a major step that I think would greatly improve the overall safeguards regime, but I’m not predicting that’s something that’s going to come easily or fast. But it gives you an idea about the strength of this agreement.</p>
<p>It is very important that that agreement be sustained. Brent Scowcroft – great friend and I think you all know who Brent is, National Security Advisor to the first President Bush – he as usual said it very concisely: “If we walk away from the Iran Agreement, we walk away alone.”</p>
<p>That would give us the worst of both worlds, because the strength of the agreement – and the reason we reached the agreement – are both due to international cohesion. The agreement was negotiated at a time when Russia and we had – and frankly still have – serious problems. Yet, the P5 – the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany – managed a negotiation with Iran. Cohesion was critical to get there. The reason we even got to the table is the cohesion of the international community in supporting economic sanctions. We all know the difference between unilateral and multilateral sanctions’ effectiveness. If we walk away alone, as Brent said, it is Pollyannaish to think that cohesion would be sustained.</p>
<p>So that’s one thing I really wanted to emphasize. And I’ll just say that the importance of it, to me, came home most effectively when the Chief of Staff of the Army, Mark Milley, said very simply: “Thank you for saving lives.” He was talking about our lives. Your lives. So this is a first message I really want to emphasize in terms of the importance of sustaining that agreement in this nonproliferation context.</p>
<p>Turning to materials more broadly, since 2009 we have removed enough material from various countries for over 160 nuclear weapons’ worth – more than 4 tons of highly enriched uranium, and just in September, Poland became the latest of 31 countries plus Taiwan to be declared free of HEU. So again, it’s very important – this is painstaking, labor-intensive work. It’s got to continue.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go. But I want to say in many of these activities, collaboration with Russia remains important. And I second message I would have is, look, we obviously have a lot of problems right now with Russia – we don’t have to go into their extent – actually I will go into a little more later on. But the fact is, at the height of the Cold War, we maintained very active interactions on these issues while we had a lot of other troubles, problems.</p>
<p>We have to find a way, frankly, in my view, renewing that level of activity. A big part of that was then and may be again with our National Laboratories doing scientist-to-scientist collaboration and being ready for the opportunity to renew the relationship in terms of our nuclear security.</p>
<p>Let me turn to the weapons programs and strategic stability – the second prong that I mentioned – clearly, one again, where we collaborated with the Navy and the military overall quite strongly. Secretary Carter – Ash Carter – recently has said several times, actually, he said it in Minot, in North Dakota, he said it at the Department of Energy, he said it several times, and I’ll quote:   “America’s nuclear deterrent is the bedrock of our security.”</p>
<p>This was, frankly, somewhat forgotten for quite a while. For good or bad reasons, it’s not being forgotten anymore. And I think attention is refocused on this and it’s very important that it is being refocused on.</p>
<p>Many believe that the risk of, you know, massive exchanges of nuclear weapons – especially between the United States and Russia – is a diminished risk – it’s a very high consequence if it happens, but that the probabilities have gone down, while the probability of a nuclear device one way or another being set off has gone up. And that’s something we have to address.</p>
<p>We have a world where, of course, we have neighbors like India and Pakistan with nuclear arsenals, we have North Korea, the only country to have tested in this century a nuclear weapon and developing missiles, and something that is of great concern and I think a real challenge for our strategic planning, is what has become in some sense a nuclear gray zone between Russia and Europe, where Russia has quite publicly now for some years put forward some doctrines that are extremely unsettling. Doctrines of de-escalating a conventional conflict by use of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>I use the word “de-escalating” in the sense that they use it – I’m not convinced that that’s a very appropriate use of the term. But the point is that these regional conflicts have a potential in this world through both technology and through doctrine to, in my view, escalate in the wrong way.</p>
<p>You know, if we go back to the 1980s, when the INF was negotiated, that was around – that wasn’t around intercontinental ballistic missiles, it was around Pershing missiles in Germany. That’s the issue. It would be extremely destabilizing to go back into that world, and unfortunately, as you know, we have stated publicly that Russia has violated the INF.</p>
<p>We know that there are dramatic new capabilities being developed by Russia – some by China as well, but focusing here on Russia, and we need to revisit exactly what we are doing and the pace of what we are doing in order to address this and to avoid a deteriorating security environment in the context of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Now we’ve negotiated with Russia, for example the New START Treaty, in this Administration, we’ve reduced our stockpile by roughly 85 percent since its peak. Just yesterday the Vice President announced that we are moving into the dismantlement queue another almost 500 warheads in addition to those previously scheduled for retirement. And this is clearly all in the direction of the Prague Agenda.</p>
<p>But, again, there are reasons for us to need a certain re-evaluation. One is the capability that is again being developed, putting our assets at much greater risk, both above and below the ocean surface, and the doctrine, as I mentioned. But also, another point is that as we reduce – and the President has said we could go down to 1,000, for example, weapons, we said that a few years ago assuming that there were some reciprocal measures from Russia in particular.</p>
<p>But at that point, or at some point, and that may be a rough kind of number, where it’s hard to see how a bilateral – as difficult as that is today given our U.S.-Russia relationship – bilateral approach – at some point that has to clearly go into a multilateral approach in terms of reductions of nuclear weapons. That will be hard enough among the P5, and now when we put in Indian and Pakistan and North Korea. But that’s the challenge that we need to pursue.</p>
<p>That then leads to our own investments, and very much again in the discussion is the better part, certainly, of a trillion dollars needed over a couple decades to modernize both our nuclear weapons stockpile and our delivery systems. But I want to be careful to define “modernize” here. Modernize does not mean generating new capabilities. Certainly in the weapons stockpile, we are committed to life extension of our weapons, not bringing in new types of weapons. Similarly, I think a lot of the discussion on the delivery systems has mistakenly been talking about qualitatively new capabilities. It’s really about restoring, or modernizing, the triad of delivery systems, including, our course, the Columbia Class submarines that we discussed as a very central part of our deterrent posture.</p>
<p>So I want to try to make it clear – certainly speaking for the DOE part, but for DOD as well – I think there is no question, we have to follow through with this modernization program, again, defined as I just did.</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of money – it is a lot of money – but the reality is in terms of, the DOE part of that is about 10 percent of the total, roughly, it has to be done for reasons I could go into including safety of our plants, because we have not invested for the order of half a century. But on the DOD side, the reality is, for what the Secretary called “the bedrock of our national security,” it amounts to a few percent of the DOD budget over the next couple of decades. And I might note, by the way, on the Columbia Class, that milestone, that OSD approved Milestone B detailed design and journey work on the new Columbia Class ballistic missile submarine just I think last week, in fact.</p>
<p>We also have made progress on modernizing the infrastructure to provide a hedge against technical and geopolitical surprise of the type that I alluded to. If I talk about Department of Energy, again that is rebuilding our uranium capabilities, our plutonium capabilities, our chemistry and metallurgy research replacement project at Los Alamos, new microelectronics capabilities, et cetera. All of those must go forward, and I might say they will also provide additional, for example, microelectronics, additional benefits in the security space.</p>
<p>Now, the program that I’m talking about for DOE in terms of the life extension, I want to emphasize, is to accomplish that continuing our no testing paradigm. We have not had a nuclear test since 1992, even including India and Pakistan. The only exception to testing since 1998 has been North Korea. So we have gone now 25 years without testing.</p>
<p>That has required building up a science-based program at our laboratories. That science-based program was put together starting in the ’90s. It had an incredible amount of innovation at its core. Nothing was off the shelf. It wasn’t just buying a few more computer boxes. It was defining a new architecture of computing to build out to the scale we need. We continue that process. It also was inventing new experimental capabilities that probe regions of pressure and temperature, for example, in the laboratory, unheard of but characteristics of a nuclear explosive device. This was all something that had to be invented.</p>
<p>I say that because now, on the testing side, there was, as many of you know, in 1999, an attempt to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It did not go well. There were two major objections raised at that time. One was that, we could not, in fact, really assure reliability of the stockpile. Secondly, it was viewed that we did not have a capacity to really detect underground tests globally.</p>
<p>Both of those problems have been resolved by technology advance. Our Stockpile Stewardship Program has led to an annual certification of the stockpile by our laboratory directors, by STRATCOM, ultimately by the Secretaries of Defense and Energy every single year. There are warts, and the report to the President, I can assure you, points out the challenges that have to be addressed. But it has always led to the statement of confidence by all involved that we have a viable stockpile. And there is nothing on the horizon to suggest that we cannot sustain this if we keep pushing the science-based program.</p>
<p>So another message I would like to leave – it’s very important for us to maintain the no-testing regime. Again, underpinning that is maintaining the commitment to the science-based program, to the life-extension program, to completing the modernization of the complex, but maintaining the no-testing regime is to our strategic advantage. And it is a deterrent to other countries getting into the game, if you like.</p>
<p>So that’s again, something, there’s been discussions about testing. I want to say very very clearly – at least again in my view – that this is very much to our advantage.</p>
<p>So, again, sustain the Iran Deal, sustain the no-testing regime, continue modernization – these are all very very critical issues that we need to stay the course on.</p>
<p>So finally, I’ll just say that – so we can get to questions – that a lot of this discussion involves the hardware side, if you like, and that’s very important. But as I said, there are also issues of strategy, of concern about changed approaches – Russia’s so-called de-escalation strategy would be an example. Concerns about our assets being put at risk. So we are going to have to have a strong approach, both on the side of the weapons – the delivery systems – sustain the issue of controlling materials, and not testing, but also getting into a revitalized, in my view, discussion, both internally and with others, especially in the P5 to start.</p>
<p>So over these last now nearly four years, I certainly have been very pleased to be part of these efforts to secure materials, to certify the stockpile, to prevent proliferation, and to map out the needs for our deterrent. However, my time is finishing, in a week, in this job, and I know, I have the confidence, that in passing the baton, you flag officers, leaders in our Armed Forces and others, will shoulder these continuing and frankly, in my view, heightened responsibilities in ways that certainly gives me confidence and ultimately, I think, can lead us to the kind of vision the President put forward in Prague eight years ago.</p>
<p>So thank you very much for your attention.</p>
