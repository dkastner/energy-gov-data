<p>And as Tom said earlier, I think it’s actually a very opportune time, both because of the place that we are at in terms of wind development, but also because of the importance of wind development in the context of the international response to climate change challenges in this very critical year for defining what that response will be over these next years.</p>
<p>So today I’d like to say a little bit about, well, what we’ve done recently together, but even more about some of what lies ahead both in the broad context of our low-carbon future and specifically in terms of wind and what the Department of Energy looks forward to, again, continuing with you so that wind does, in fact, reach the Wind Vision, as has been defined, and thereby contribute to our critical challenges going ahead.</p>
<p>Let me say a little bit about this year in the climate world and what is often called the road to Paris. It will of course be a critical meeting in December to hopefully define a very ambitious agenda towards low carbon from the global community.  I think it’s fair to say that this goes back seven, eight months, specifically prior to the joint announcement by Presidents Xi and Obama about China and the United States’ objectives, targets for low carbon.  If you go back to that period prior to that announcement, I would say there was a lot of skepticism in terms of the foundation that had been laid for success in the Paris discussions.  I feel today – while this is not Pollyannaish, and we have lots and lots to do – I think the general perception of where we are today is very, very much different in terms of the groundwork being laid for important steps forward in the – in the Paris discussions.</p>
<p>Now, in the discussions about climate change, I think, again, in the public arena, in the political arena, we have made a lot of progress in terms of how that discussion is going on.  It doesn’t change the fact that there are some – also some disappointing comments in some of that political discourse on climate.  As I said, going back, in fact, to the period of my confirmation, that we really need, all of us, to move beyond, frankly, fruitless debates about things that should not be debatable in terms of the need for taking strong and prudent steps towards a low-carbon future. </p>
<p>And there what we really need to do is to understand that the challenges are multiple.  In fact, President Obama, in his Climate Act Plan in June of 2013 – coming up on the two-year anniversary of that – very clearly laid out that we have this major challenge about mitigating the impacts of climate.  And that, of course, comes right back to the issue of significantly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  But we also have the challenge of adapting to what we are already seeing around us as the impacts of global warming and climate change and, regrettably, what we anticipate as greater impacts – impacts that, of course, would be minimized by having more success on the mitigation side.</p>
<p>Jacob mentioned rather amusing Jon Stewart interaction a couple weeks ago.  But I must say that in another interview a couple of weeks ago with Charlie Rose led to a better, perhaps flippant but I think appropriate, statement that when you look around at the at the patterns of drought, sea-level rise, acidification of oceans, wildfires – we could go on and on – that there’s the old statement that, you know, if it – if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.  And I think that really kind of summarizes where we should be in our discussion with climate change.</p>
<p>Now, today what I want to discuss a little bit is some of the steps this year towards Paris, some of the steps beyond Paris, and of course, critically, the role of and the importance of wind in that – in that – in that context.  And let me just say a few things about this year – well, actually, starting to go back to the end of last year and, again, with the Xi-Obama announcement in November. </p>
<p>What I want to emphasize first, in terms of the Chinese investment, is that there is much attention focused on, A, the very fact that China took on responsibilities for CO2 emissions abatement is itself a very important statement – the peaking of CO2 emissions by 2030 or earlier, very important.  But I really want to emphasize another part of it, which – and it’s a challenging target, and certainly important for wind – and that was the Chinese commitment to 20 percent of non-fossil energy by 2030.  That corresponds to really a generation as opposed to a capacity equivalent to the gigawatt-per-week addition from now to 2030.  So it gives you kind of an idea of the scale.  And obviously wind is going to be an important part of that. </p>
<p>With China and the United States representing, you know, nearly half of global emissions, we can understand the importance of that, as well as the U.S. commitment to a 17 percent reduction by 2020 and then a 26 to 28 percent reduction relative to 2005 by 2025.  If you do that arithmetic, you can see how this fits into the kind of vision that Tom laid out earlier in terms of robust deployment of wind to 2020.  But because those targets we laid out actually call for doubling the pace of carbon reductions beyond 2020, that idea of then wind deployments, for example, upping the ante after 2020 just fits hand-in-glove with those kinds of targets that we – that we laid out.  So we are also counting on you for being a huge part of the solution to that climate challenge.</p>
<p>A few things coming up, just so you know.  Actually, next week in – just to give you a few examples.  Next week in Mexico we will have two critical meetings.  One is the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas, followed immediately by what’s called the Clean Energy Ministerial, which involves over 20 countries that collectively account for practically all of the emissions in the world.  Of course, saying that these meetings are occurring in Mexico of course raises the fact that at the end of March Mexico itself came out with a very important declaration of targets, so-called INDCs, for Paris, and that was very significant in the sense of here we have a major emerging economy coming out with an ambitious target to contribute to the Paris discussion.  And then, at the same time, the presidents of Mexico and the United States announced a joint task force to pursue the solutions in a joint way. </p>
<p>And in that context, the Mexican energy reforms are extremely critical.  In particular, besides the often-discussed reform of the hydrocarbon sector, very important and certainly important for this group potentially is the increased opportunity for electricity integration across the border.  And there we can see how we can find renewables in both countries as a potential way of both of us meeting our targets.  And then, of course, just on Friday our neighbor to the north, Canada, coming out with its declaration of a – of a 30 percent target by 2030. </p>
<p>So this is just part of the theme that I think, again, in this changed environment, as we think about Paris, seeing, you know, Europe and the United States and China and Mexico and Canada and others coming out with consistent, ambitious targets is very encouraging.  And again, as I’ll come to in more detail, I think – I think basically all of us see wind as a very important part of meeting those objectives.</p>
<p>I should say that the – in terms of the U.S.-Mexico task force, I’m pleased to be the U.S. chair of that.  And we will be meeting next week to advance that agenda. </p>
<p>Just two other steps on the road to Paris that I think are worth mentioning.  One is that – again, back to our discussions with China – the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue will take place in D.C. next month, another opportunity for our countries to move forward with our – with our joint objectives and to engage with the private sector.  And then finally, another step on the way to Paris, in November I will have the opportunity to chair a biannual energy ministerial meeting of the International Energy Agency in Paris.  But again, what I want to emphasize is our theme is going to be something that fits very directly into what we’ve already heard this morning:  the importance of continued technology innovation, of continued cost reduction for all of the low-carbon technologies as essential to the solution to climate risk – climate risk mitigation.</p>
<p>So those are just some of the – some of the steps that we will be seeing this year.  And I just really want to keep emphasizing that accelerating the deployment of our low-carbon, our zero-carbon solutions is absolutely, absolutely critical.</p>
<p>Let’s turn to – more specifically to wind.  And as you know – this audience knows very well we’re now at a point where – still not widely enough recognized, in my view, that wind is now producing nearly 5 percent of our – of our electricity.  Lisa mentioned a number.  I must say a number that I like thinking ahead is the 1 trillion kilowatt-hours per year.  We have a nice target, roughly speaking five times today’s amount.  It might take us a decade or a bit more to get there, but that should be a nice round number to be able to roll off, a trillion kilowatt-hours per year.  And of course, the – since President Obama took office, the – you know, a tripling of capacity, and that’s the kind of multiplier that we are going to see, you know, going forward.</p>
<p>I might say there’s been some kind words already this morning about the Department of Energy’s role in this.  And I’ll say a little bit – a little bit more about that, but there are ways in which we’ve also contributed that are far less well-known.  </p>
<p>For example, the – I don’t know how many of you have passed the quiz:  What is the largest federally owned wind farm in the United States?  I won’t wait for the – for the – for the answers.  It may be surprising that it is a wind farm built by Siemens, actually, using an ESPC approach at Pantex.  Many of you probably don’t know what Pantex is.  It’s one of our nuclear weapons production plants.  So I want to assure you we’re doing green nuclear weapons as well.  And that’s just a little part of what we are doing to move forward.</p>
<p>Again, wind cost reduction – again, things that you all know about – but again, I cannot emphasize enough how much for wind, and for all of our other low-carbon solutions, innovation, cost reduction, they go hand in hand.  That is in many ways the objective.  And as we will talk about today, while, as Lisa said, certainly we have reached targets like, you know, roughly 5 cents per kilowatt hour for wind in favorable situations, what we have to do is make that kind of a target much, much more ubiquitous so that you can expand wind deployment.</p>
<p>Now, already mentioned a few times has been the Wind Vision Report that we put out in March.  And that was a vision that was developed over time, and I’m sure many in this audience contributed to that – to that Wind Vision.  Looking to, again, I would say, passing that trillion kilowatt-hours, at – certainly in this half-century and hopefully earlier.  But that Wind Vision Report emphasized several directions that are critical.</p>
<p>Once again, and I can – I never tire of repeating it:  decreasing costs through technology innovation, but also the very critical step of essentially expanding the  footprint of wind, of parts of the country where wind is an economically attractive option, of course, once again, through technology development.  The Wind Vision talked about, you know, improvements like longer blades, taller towers, improved drive trains, controls, sensors, et cetera.  Making lower wind speeds economically feasible, capturing the wind resource at higher heights, all of that – all of that coming together will be very, very critical.</p>
<p>So today I’m pleased to say that we are releasing now a second report, I would say a follow-on or a companion report to Wind Vision.  It’s called Enabling Wind Power Nationwide.  And this is specifically addressed at that challenge of greatly expanding the footprint of good, strong wind economic performance, addressing the issue of how the wind resource in all 50 states can be captured – again, a few things – a lot of higher hub heights and larger rotors and improved siting. </p>
<p>So, for example, you will find in the – in the report that will be available – that’s available, again, today – that as we go to hub heights, let’s say, above a hundred meters, we are talking about a one-half to two-thirds expansion of a highly viable wind resource.  And in fact, as we know, getting up a hundred meters and more, it’s not like that is unheard of.  Quite the contrary, it is – it is done today in parts of Europe.  If we can bring that technology here, deploy it, continue with innovation, as I said, we see an enormously expanded footprint, specifically including here in the Southeast, where there’s been this idea somehow that wind just doesn’t fit here.  We think that’s not correct as we pursue the kinds of steps that are outlined in the – in the Enabling Wind Power Nationwide report that, again, we are – we are expanding today.</p>
<p>Now, we will also, of course, be continuing our wind research programs – many of them, again, in collaboration with many of the companies here in this conference, excuse me.  And I want to just say that, besides the R&amp;D that, you know, again, addressed these questions of materials for longer blades, et cetera, of course, we also will also continue some of our more interesting, or rather maybe – you may think longshot, but, you know, like, cutting-edge approaches – things like tethered airborne wind turbines through our R&amp;D programs, maybe looking at vertical-axis wind turbines, of course floating deepwater, floating concepts.  In fact, offshore wind research, an area where clearly we have to push for significant continued cost reduction, is an area that we will continue to fund and move forward, both on – on both coasts, perhaps even in the – in the Great Lakes.  And there are other still technologies – opportunities to be discussed, like the Google discussion about – you know, a backbone of transmission – DC transmission.  Just to indicate that we are – we are far from constraining the R&amp;D horizon, but we will work simultaneously at some of these farther-out concepts while we work with you in terms of the more near-term payoffs of, again, issues like higher hub heights and the like.</p>
<p>We also will address infrastructure and logistics.  In fact, another document that if you have not seen I’d like to call to your attention was the – is the first installment of the – of the Quadrennial Energy Review.  As the word “quadrennial” suggests, it’s a four-year cycle.  It is something that was put forward in the President’s Climate Act Plan in 2013 and then formally kicked off by executive order in January of 2014.  It’s quadrennial, but what we have taken is a – what we call a moving-spotlight approach, in which, rather than waiting four years for a brand-new masterpiece, on a roughly annual basis we will put out important focus areas for subsequent integration over the four-year time scale.</p>
<p>This first year – and the report was released roughly a month ago.  And the focus for this first year, as laid out in the Climate Act Plan, was on energy infrastructure – the transmission, storage and distribution of energy.  Supply issues, et cetera, and demand-side issues will come with the next installment, but this year, again, it was the infrastructure.  But of course, looking at the infrastructure as how it would enable an energy system for the 21<sup>st</sup> century with everything from, of course, integration of very large-scale renewables to the kinds of resilience issues that we will need with enhanced – with growing extreme weather, again, as we – as we anticipate, and the like.</p>
<p>Just want to say – I have to admit it – the photograph has a certain amusement for value for something that is not funny at all, which is we chose to put a photograph in there in terms of transportation logistics of the movement in Europe, it turned out, of an 80-meter blade and seeing how the 80-meter blade took a left-hand turn on some roads is an incredibly great visual of the kinds of infrastructure challenges that we face in going forward with energy, but with wind specifically.  As you well know, moving blades, moving the increasingly large towers, the kinds of towers that we need for this Wind Vision and nationwide Wind Vision, is quite a serious issue, calling for more innovation as well.</p>
<p>Also, in the context of this QER, of infrastructure, just wanted to say there’s a lot of discussion about, of course, as I already mentioned, the integration of variable resources into the grid.  It’s an important issue, but we also have to keep in mind the perspective that we have seen in many places very, very substantial uses of wind with grid integration handled, in fact, quite well.  And the QER comes to the conclusion that – again, without minimizing the challenges, especially as we get to very, very large penetrations – but without getting – without losing the perspective, we point out that actually the scale of the investment needed in high-voltage transmission to build this 21<sup>st</sup>-century clean-energy infrastructure is in no way out of bounds with current investment levels.  Currently there’s about $15 billion a year being invested in high-voltage transmission, and about a quarter of that is driven specifically by the integration – by the capture of wind resources.  So, again, I would urge you as well to look at that report as something of interest.</p>
<p>In closing, let me say a little bit about resources, finances.  Again, this is another area where we need innovation.  Just to mention a few areas already this morning, things like yieldcos were mentioned as a vehicle for private investment, very important.  Let me just say a few words in the – in the federal resource arena.</p>
<p>First of all, we will continue to support the, again, acceleration – I cannot overemphasize – the acceleration of the deployment of clean energy.  One of the vehicles that we have used over the last years, and I want to emphasize will continue to use, is our loan program.  We have over $30 billion in play.  We have about $40 billion of remaining authority.  It is not – it is not fully unrestrained in terms of the areas where we can use it, but we do have a $4 billion program right now active for additional renewables and efficiency programs.  Probably many of you saw we made a conditional commitment some months ago to Cape Wind.  We will see where the future of that project – but it’s just indicative that we’re not going to stop investing and trying to move the footprint forward in wind and in other renewables and efficiency projects.</p>
<p>A second area, of course, of federal resources is the issue of our annual appropriations.  We are now in the middle of the markups for the fiscal year 2016 budget.  I can’t say the prospects today are completely pleasant, but of course right now the House has already marked up.  The Senate subcommittee will probably mark up this afternoon.  And they are operating under the budget caps, which is highly constrained.  That will cascade down to things like the renewables budgets. </p>
<p>But the President has been very consistent, and many in Congress are calling very, very clearly for moving beyond those caps.  They just do not reflect the need that we have right now in both the civilian and defense budgets, especially at a time when, you know, if we look up and recognize that things like, you know, the budget deficit against GDP, which looked to be, you know, off-scale in the 2008-2009 period of recession, is actually back to historic levels.  And we need to make the investments in our – in our infrastructure, in our – in our clean energy future.</p>
<p>And finally, it was already mentioned but I just want to reinforce that, of course, the production tax credit is critical.  The administration has made clear the need to renew in a – in a predictable way as part of our clean-energy future.  And the FY ’16 President’s request includes a $7.4 billion request for clean-energy technologies, including scoring of a permanent extension of the PTC and, as part of business tax reform, making it refundable.</p>
<p>So, again, just to – just to recap, we think this is a very, very important time for our climate challenge and for wind truly to be a major part of a solution to that – to that challenge.  We will be very active, as I said earlier, rolling – traveling on the road to Paris, trying to see that we have international, ambitious commitments to low carbon, that those commitments increasingly are backed up by viable, implementable, verifiable national plans to meet those commitments. </p>
<p>Needless to say, a set of ambitious commitments of this type coming from economies of various levels of development will augur extremely well for wind.  And so we need to keep working to get that technology evolving; to keep, again, driving down the costs; to getting deployments that greatly enlarge the footprint for economic deployment of wind.  And if we can do that – and, frankly, only if we can do that – will we all be able to hit our necessary and ambitious targets for carbon reduction.</p>
<p> Again, so thank you for your – for your efforts in this – in this dimension.  Again, they are of critical importance.  And we certainly look forward to continuing our productive work together to reach – to reach our shared goals.  Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
