<p><strong>Applications</strong><br />Harnessing IT for business advantage all comes down to technology-enabled applications. So it’s no surprise that an organization’s application management strategy has a direct impact on how well the enterprise operates and competes.  The size and complexity of the applications portfolio and the number of projects in play at any given time are increasing. But the investment-recovery time of applications has collapsed dramatically—to less than two years. Application managers are under more pressure than ever to rapidly deliver results across the entire applications portfolio while reducing the natural disruptions of change.</p>
<p><strong>Business Intelligence</strong><br />Business intelligence is more than just information dissemination and executive decision making. It’s about driving higher business performance and impact with a pervasive approach that empowers a larger and broader set of people, business applications and business processes.  Gartner for IT Leaders helps business intelligence leaders raise awareness about the true opportunities for business intelligence and information management. You’ll learn how you can enable people to create positive impact on business process and operational performance throughout the entire organization.</p>
<p><strong>Business Process Improvement </strong><br />Business processes are key to realizing the organization’s vision and keeping its strategy on track when conditions change. Since all enterprises execute their vision and strategy through daily operations, focusing on continual process improvement is critical to achieving sustained business advantage. Gartner helps business process improvement leaders stay on top of the knowledge and technology-related insight needed to ensure your business processes can meet the challenges of today’s global competitive climate.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Architecture</strong><br />Impacting the organization’s ability to mobilize technology for business advantage is a task every enterprise architect wants to undertake. But the daily pressures and demands of system delivery and operations often get in the way of creating and leveraging effective enterprise architecture (EA).  Gartner for IT Leaders helps enterprise architects focus on both the strategic and tactical aspects of their role. We help you create your strategy and plans for enterprise architecture while extending your creative abilities to exploit technology’s full strategic value.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure and Operations</strong><br />CIO’s entrust a large portion of their budget to people who lead and manage IT infrastructure and operations. Reliable infrastructures that provide both operational excellence and the flexibility to respond to an enterprise’s strategic changes can mean the difference between success and failure. Gartner assists IT infrastructure and operations leaders in delivering superior operations while they contribute to business advantage. Focused access to relevant insight and resources and connection to an online peer community empower IT infrastructure and operations leaders with the confidence to make the everyday, critical decisions to succeed in both the tactical and strategic aspects of the job.</p>
<p><strong>Program and Portfolio Management</strong><br />When major investments are committed to achieving strategic objectives or changing the way an organization operates, good project management skills are a given. But how do you organize and manage in today’s world of multiple project streams—whether integrated into a strategic program, governed by a project/program management office (PMO) or evaluated and prioritized as a set of competing programs and initiatives?</p>
<p><strong>Security and Risk Management</strong><br />In stark contrast to attitudes of five to ten years ago, senior management teams now consider the security leader’s role both strategic and permanent. But in most enterprises, security and risk management remain the least mature IT-related functions.  Gartner for IT leaders helps security and risk management leaders protect the enterprise from threats without impeding the business. Focused access to relevant insight and resources and connection to an online peer community empower IT security leaders with the confidence to make the everyday, critical decisions to succeed in both the tactical and strategic aspects of the job.</p>
<p><strong>Sourcing and Vendor Relationships</strong><br />Many sourcing and vendor decisions are made ad hoc, as tactical reactions to immediate needs. In the end, costs aren’t effectively controlled, service effectiveness is compromised, and customer satisfaction suffers. Nearly all organizations have room for improvement in their sourcing competencies and vendor relationships. Whether you’re procuring products or services, we help educate you with current sourcing techniques and fresh thinking. You learn how your approach to sourcing and strategic vendor relationships contributes to growth, global expansion, increased agility, profitability and business advantage.<br />We have broken down the fees based on hourly charges to support differing requirements and deliverables driving each individual statement of work.</p>
