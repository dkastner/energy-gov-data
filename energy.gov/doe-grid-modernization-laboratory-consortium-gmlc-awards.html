The Nation’s power grid, however, is aging and faces a future for which it was not designed. As part of the GMI, the Energy Department announced [add link to press release] funding in January, 2016 of up to $220 million over three years for DOE’s National Labs and partners. The Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium funding will support critical research and development in advanced storage systems, clean energy integration, standards and test procedures, and a number of other key grid modernization areas. This effort recognizes regional differences and will strengthen regional strategies while defining a diverse and balanced national strategy. A list of the projects appears below.

The Nation’s power grid, however, is aging and faces a future for which it was not designed.</p>
<p>The Energy Department’s <a href="under-secretary-science-and-energy/grid-modernization-initiative.html">Grid Modernization Initiative (GMI)</a> represents a comprehensive effort to help shape the future of our nation’s grid and solve the challenges of integrating conventional and renewable sources with energy storage and smart buildings, while ensuring that the grid is resilient and secure to withstand growing cybersecurity and climate challenges. Through the GMI and its <a href="sites/prod/files/2016/01/f28/Grid&#32;Modernization&#32;Multi-Year&#32;Program&#32;Plan.pdf">Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP)</a>, the Department will help frame new grid architecture design elements, develop new planning and real-time operations platforms, provide metrics and analytics to improve grid performance, and enhance government and industry capabilities for designing the infrastructure and regulatory models needed for successful grid modernization. The MYPP builds on concepts and recommendations from DOE’s recently released <a href="epsa/initiatives/quadrennial-energy-review-qer.html">Quadrennial Energy Review</a> and <a href="quadrennial-technology-review-2015.html">Quadrennial Technology Review.</a></p>
<p>As part of the GMI, the Energy Department <a href="articles/doe-announces-220-million-grid-modernization-funding.html">announced</a> funding in January, 2016 of up to $220 million over three years for DOE’s National Labs and partners. <a href="under-secretary-science-and-energy/grid-modernization-lab-consortium.html">The Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium</a> funding will support critical research and development in advanced storage systems, clean energy integration, standards and test procedures, and a number of other key grid modernization areas. This effort recognizes regional differences and will strengthen regional strategies while defining a diverse and balanced national strategy. In addition to projects that address the needs of incorporating individual grid technologies like solar or energy storage, DOE is also developing crosscutting projects that have impact across multiple technologies. A list of the projects appears below. <strong>Note: funding amounts listed below are subject to appropriations and to final negotiations with award recipients</strong>. </p>

<td>Project 1: Market and Reliability Opportunities for Wind on the Bulk Power System</td>
<td>
<p>This project aims to create a modeling framework that will model timescales from decades to seconds to help analyze the impact of wind generation on the power system while considering realistic market design and strategies. This framework will provide the ability to model the impacts of wind on the economics and reliability of the grid in a realistic market environment. Most integration studies have focused on modeling the physical characteristics of the grid, but market inefficiencies can hinder access to the physical flexibility that is available, as noted in the Wind Vision Roadmap. The inability of previous studies to consider these market impacts on system operations are a significant shortcoming of previous work in wind integration. In this study, we propose a framework that considers the market impacts on revenue sufficiency and therefore resource adequacy and system reliability. Without the ability to represent realistic markets in future models and studies, system operators and regulators will not be able to integrate wind generation efficiently, creating a more difficult and costly transition to a modern electric power system.</p>

Through use of publicly-available map-based layout, such as Google Maps, the network information, such as power flows, generation dispatch, etc., will be displayed to avail the wide-area information.

<p>Idaho National Lab's concurrent cooling–Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) is an example of additional data that needs to be effectively integrated into control rooms. The DLR project supports the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (DOE-EERE) mission to provide high-impact research, development, and demonstration to make clean energy as affordable and convenient as traditional forms of energy by establishing a means to increase the integration of renewable energy generation with the associated increase in transmission line capacity, which are traditionally limited by conductor thermal capacity and can be significantly underutilized. These projects take a science-based approach to advance line rating standards through an innovative methodology. These projects also develop various technology improvements utilizing dynamic, real-time environmental conditions measured and modeled using computational fluid dynamics, leading to average line capacity improvements of 10–40% above static ratings. The weather station data and ampacity calculation comprise an additional layer of data. Utilities would like to utilize this new capacity to enable additional power flow when the need to transmit power coincides with conducive meteorological conditions (concurrent cooling). Conveying the information to allow the operator to make an informed decision based on this additional information is important to more effective utilization of the transmission asset. Even more important is the timely notification when conditions change in a negative direction as the extra capacity is actively being used.</p>

To realize this goal, the team will build upon the capabilities of ‘TS3ph’, a dynamics simulator developed through the DOE-OE AGMR funded project “High-fidelity ‘faster than real-time’ simulator for predicting power system dynamic behavior.” The project will focus on advancing the modeling, simulation, analysis, and visualization capabilities of TS3ph-CAPE through the following innovation pathways:  Fill current industry modeling gaps, accelerate dynamics simulation, develop new analysis metrics, create new situational awareness capabilities, and validate and verify the developed dynamics simulator with standard industry tools, and observed data.</p>

<td>Project 1: Development of an Open-Source Platform for Advanced Distribution Management Systems</td>
<td>
<p>An initial version of an open source integrated software platform for varying vendor systems will be developed which supports the full suite of distribution management applications (such as voltage and reactive power optimization; fault location, isolation, and service restoration; economic dispatches; and optimization routines). This integrated platform, based on specifications and requirements to be developed jointly with utilities, will allow information to flow between individual applications across the entire utility enterprise, enabling enhanced visibility and controllability of system assets. Development and evaluation of the ADMS platform will be conducted in a utility-centric environment, involving qualified system operators from distribution utilities of varying sizes, to ensure that the capabilities being developed are applicable to the largest possible cross section of utilities. Investments leveraging the increased types and volume of available system data, due to a recent surge in advanced technology deployments, will also be explored to develop new applications. These new applications will greatly enhance observability and controllability required to integrate large amounts of renewables in a safe and effective manner, utilize assets more efficiently during restorations, enable much wider range of choices for consumers, and maintain affordable electricity rates.</p>
