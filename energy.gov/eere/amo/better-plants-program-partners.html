<p><em>Navistar, Inc. is an international manufacturer of  International® brand commercial and military trucks; MaxxForce® brand diesel engines; IC Bus™ brand school and commercial buses, as well as a provider of service parts for trucks and diesel engines.   As a member of the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings, Better Plants Program, Navistar, Inc. is proud to take its place as a leader in industrial energy efficiency and support the nation's drive toward a sustainable, clean-energy future.</em></p>
<p><strong>Date of Pledge:</strong> January 2012</p>
<p><strong>Successes:</strong> In partnership with the Better Plants Program, Navistar, Inc. has achieved a 1.64% energy intensity improvement from its baseline consumption.</p>
<p>The company utilized the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Performance Tracking Tool (EnPI 2.0) to develop energy intensities to accurately track its facilities' energy conservation efforts and to establish meaningful energy intensity goals. In January 2012, the company started including energy intensity improvement data in its monthly Environmental and Energy Scorecard reports to senior management.</p>
<p>In 2008, Navistar Inc.'s senior management approved a $2 million Energy Fund. In 2011, another $3 million was dedicated to support energy capital projects. The approval of Navistar, Inc.'s Energy Fund is a key component of the company's energy management strategy to significantly reduce its energy costs, as well as the environmental impacts resulting from its activities, services, and products. More recently Navistar has focused on energy reduction “Treasure Hunts” to identify low cost to no cost opportunities.  Besides the emphasis to reduce energy and increase efficiencies of existing equipment, the Treasure Hunt training helps to build a culture of energy conservation.</p>
<p>In 2013, Navistar achieved 24 percent reduction in absolute GHG emissions, meeting its goal of 20 percent GHG reduction by 2013, using 2008 as baseline. Facility closing and lower production volumes at certain Navistar facilities during 2013 contributed to 8% reductions in GHG emissions.  The remaining 16% of the GHG reductions came from energy efficiency initiatives, conservation efforts and the $5 million Energy Funds.</p>
<p>Through the Better Plants Program, Navistar Inc. has benefitted from significant training and benchmarking opportunities with subject matter experts in industrial equipment and energy conservation. Specifically, experts from Department of Energy and University of Dayton Industrial Assessment Center conducted an In-Plant Training at its Springfield, Ohio truck assembly plant in October 2012. The company also attended a Better Plants Program Workshop at DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory on benchmarking with fellow Better Buildings Program participants.</p>
