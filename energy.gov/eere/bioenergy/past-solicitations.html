<h5><a id="Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima)" name="Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima)">Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima)</a></h5>
<p>On December 29, 2016, the Energy Department (DOE) <a href="../articles/energy-department-announces-7-million-co-optimization-fuels-and-engines.html">announced up to $7 million</a> for eight universities to accelerate the introduction of affordable, scalable, and sustainable high-performance fuels for use in high-efficiency, low-emission engines. Under the Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative, DOE’s Bioenergy Technologies Office and Vehicle Technologies Office are collaborating to maximize energy savings and on-road vehicle performance, while dramatically reducing transportation-related petroleum consumption and harmful emissions. </p>
<p>DOE selected eight universities under the Co-Optima funding opportunity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cornell University (Ithaca, New York)</strong>: Cornell University, in partnership with the University of California, San Diego, will examine the combustion characteristics of several diesel/biofuel blends. This will provide the information needed to understand how these blends burn compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels to help design cleaner, more efficient combustion engines.</li>
<li><strong>University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan)</strong>: The University of Michigan will develop an engine combustion model using software that is capable of simulating a range of different parameters that could occur in a combustion chamber, such as combustion duration, flame speed, and pressure development. The system will be designed to maximize ease of use, reliability and accuracy, as well as to reduce the expense of a full engine cycle simulation by 80% relative to the current state of the art. The data gained from the model can help maximize alternative fuel performance and will be used to guide engine manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>University of Michigan-Dearborn (Dearborn, Michigan)</strong>: The University of Michigan-Dearborn, with partner Oakland University, will use a miniature ignition screening rapid compression machine—an experimental apparatus used to study ignition properties—to gain a better understanding of the ignition and combustion characteristics (e.g., ignition delay) of alternative fuels. This novel method streamlines the evaluation of auto-ignition performance without the need for more extensive and costly engine testing.</li>
<li><strong>University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa, Alabama)</strong>: The University of Alabama will examine the combustion properties of biofuels and blends using advanced diagnostic techniques under realistic advanced compression ignition (ACI) engine conditions. ACI engines can deliver both high efficiencies and low emissions. The goal is to create a model to predict combustion properties of various fuel blends to help optimize its use in ACI engines.</li>
<li><strong>Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, Louisiana)</strong>: Louisiana State University, along with partners Texas A&amp;M and University of Connecticut, will develop a method that efficiently characterizes alternative fuel candidates along with associated models and metrics for predicted engine performance. </li>
<li><strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts)</strong>: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in partnership with University of Central Florida, will develop detailed kinetic models for several biofuels using an advanced computational approach. The project will construct computer models to predict the combustion chemistry of proposed biofuels, which can then be used to determine which of the proposed fuels will have high performance in advanced engines.</li>
<li><strong>Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut)</strong>: Yale University, along with the Pennsylvania State University, will measure sooting tendencies of various biofuels and develop emission indices relevant to real engines. This will enable the selection of biomass-derived fuels that minimize soot emissions in next generation engines.</li>
<li><strong>University of Central Florida (Orlando, Florida)</strong>: The University of Central Florida will generate fuel characterization data by measuring and evaluating important performance metrics like fuel spray atomization, flame topology, volatility, viscosity, soot/coking, and compatibility for prioritized fuels. The research will characterize and predict combustion properties of biomass‐based, low-emission fuels and blends in engine‐relevant conditions.</li>

<p>On May 16, 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy <a href="../articles/doe-announces-10-million-innovative-bioenergy-research-and-development.html">announced up to $10 million in funding</a> for six projects representing innovative technologies and solutions to advance bioenergy development. These projects, located in Arizona, California, North Carolina, Delaware, and Illinois, will support the Bioenergy Technologies Office's (BETO) work to develop renewable and cost-competitive biofuels from non-food biomass feedstocks by reducing the technical risk associated with potentially breakthrough approaches and technologies for investors. This funding will also support the development of a more robust bioeconomy, which can create green jobs, spur innovation, improve the environment, and achieve national energy security. </p>
<p>The following projects were selected:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona—</strong>This project will engineer cyanobacteria for the production of ethyl laurate, which is easily converted to "drop-in" ready (i.e., compatible with existing infrastructure) biofuels or bioproducts. This uses carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and light as the main inputs, and does not waste carbon and energy by limiting the amount of biomass produced. </li>
<li><strong>Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona—</strong>This project will develop mixotrophic algae which can consume both CO2 <em>and </em>cellulosic sugars, and significantly improve algal biomass growth. These heat-tolerant strains will be grown in in photobioreactors, potentially reducing evaporation and eliminating the need for cooling. </li>
<li><strong>Duke University, Durham, North Carolina—</strong>This project will enable a dramatic reduction in costs for commercial-scale biorefineries through "dynamic metabolic control." Using the patent-pending Synthetic Metabolic Valve technology to demonstrate process intensification technology, which allows smaller reactors to be much more productive, the team will develop this process for the production of a fuel precursor. More importantly, this technology could be applied to many other bioprocesses to produce biochemicals and biofuels. </li>
<li><strong>Lygos Inc., Emeryville, California—</strong>This project will develop microbial catalysts to convert renewable cellulosic sugars into higher-value commodity and specialty chemicals. The project will then develop an integrated process from cellulosic glucose through fermentative production of a high-value chemical, aspartic acid, which has several end uses including bio-degradable polymers, fertilizers, and even cosmetics, and can be produced at high efficiencies and rates, driving production costs down.</li>
<li><strong>White Dog Labs, New Castle, Delaware—</strong>This project will develop new metabolic pathways in microorganisms so that they can concurrently consume a cellulosic sugar feedstock and CO2, thus limiting the amount of CO2 released from the process. </li>
<li><strong>LanzaTech Inc., Skokie, Illinois—</strong> This project will work on technology to enable manufacturing of the high-value industrial chemical building block, acetone, via biomass-derived syngas. </li>

<p>The two DOE projects will focus on the development of diverse cost-effective technologies for the use of cellulosic biomass in the production of biofuels, bioenergy, as well as a range of biobased products (including chemicals, animal feeds, and power) that potentially can increase the economic feasibility of fuel production in a biorefinery.</p>
<p>The DOE selections are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus, OH</strong>–The OSU project is titled “Biomass Gasification for Chemicals Production Using Chemical Looping Techniques.” OSU proposes to develop the biomass to syngas (BTS) chemical looping process for efficient production of value-added chemicals and liquid fuels from biomass. This BTS process is expected to deliver high quality syngas from biomass in a single step, with a potential to reduce capital costs for syngas production by 44% compared to conventional processes.  </li>
<li><strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA</strong>–The MIT project is titled “Improving Tolerance of Yeast to Lignocellulose-derived Feedstocks and Products.”  The primary goal of this research is to enhance production of cellulosic ethanol by improving tolerance towards three common inhibitors during cellulosic ethanol production. This same tolerance mechanism is expected to also enhance production of products beyond ethanol, such as monoethylene glycol, an important precursor material used in the production of bottling, fabrics, and anti-freeze.  </li>

<p>On October 7, 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded $7 million to five advanced biofuels projects to perform research and development that will advance cost-effective, practical technology needed to stabilize biomass fast pyrolysis oils. Pyrolysis oil is derived from cellulosic biomass feedstocks; through a multistep stabilization process, pyrolysis offers the potential of a greenhouse gas neutral, renewable, and domestically produced feedstock for petroleum refineries. The finished product is indistinguishable from current hydrocarbon fuels produced from petroleum feedstocks. Combined with a minimum cost share of 20%, more than $8.75 million will be invested in the following projects:</p>

</ul>
<p>These projects will demonstrate the thermochemical conversion process of turning switchgrass, corn stover, wood, and the non-edible parts of other organic materials into biofuel. The five projects will validate technologies for removing contaminants from biomass-derived synthesis gas to very low levels. After verifying that the proposed cleanup technology can achieve the required low contaminant level, the projects will advance to the second phase where a fuel synthesis train will be coupled to the gas cleanup system. The fuel synthesis train will use catalysts to convert the cleaned synthesis gas to Fischer Tropsch (FT) hydrocarbons and/or mixed alcohols.</p>
<p>Emery Energy Company will demonstrate conversion to both hydrocarbons and mixed alcohols, while the other four projects will only produce FT hydrocarbons. This research promises to validate effective technology to eliminate contaminants generated during biomass gasification to levels necessary to protect the expensive catalysts used for subsequent fuels synthesis from poisoning.</p>

<p>The additional funding was granted to enable the BRCs to begin research on an accelerated schedule. Partners for the project include a total of seven DOE national laboratories, 18 universities, 1 nonprofit organization, and a range of private companies. A major focus will be on reengineering biological processes to develop more efficient methods for converting cellulosic material, including agricultural residues, grasses, poplar trees, inedible plants, and non-edible portions of crops, into ethanol or other biofuels that serve as a substitute for gasoline.

<h5><a id="Cellulosic_Ethanol_Conversion" name="Cellulosic_Ethanol_Conversion">Cellulosic Ethanol Conversio</a>n</h5>
<p>On March 27, 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it will award $23 million over the next four years to five projects focused on developing highly efficient fermentative organisms to convert biomass material into ethanol. Commercialization of fermentative organisms, capable of fermenting both hexose and pentose sugars, is crucial to the success of biochemical-based integrated biorefineries. The criteria used in selecting these projects include the organism's stated capacity to convert lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol; the robustness of the organism in process-relevant conditions; and commercial market economics. Additionally, it was specified that the organism must be able to survive a wide range of environmental and process conditions and remain stable from adverse mutation. The five projects selected for award are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cargill Incorporated (Minneapolis, Minnesota), to receive up to $4.4 million. To learn more, visit the <a href="../../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.cargill-etm.com%252Fenergy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Cargill Incorporated Energy website</a>.</li>

<h5><a name="Integrated_Cellulosic_Biorefineries" id="Integrated_Cellulosic_Biorefineries">Integrated Cellulosic Biorefineries</a></h5>
<p>On February 28, 2007, the Department of Energy (DOE) selected six biorefinery projects to develop commercial-scale integrated biorefineries demonstrating the use of a wide variety of cellulosic feedstocks such as corn fiber, wood wastes, agriculture residues, municipal solid wastes and potential energy crops. The collective goal of these projects is to demonstrate that integrated biorefineries can operate profitably once their construction costs are covered and can be replicated.</p>
<p>Since selection on February 28, two of the projects were withdrawn, leaving four projects to reach award. DOE will invest up to $272 million in the four projects over the next four years. When fully operational, these facilities will be capable of producing more than 98.1 million gallons of ethanol per year.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the refining process for cellulosic ethanol is more complex than that of corn-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol yields a somewhat greater net energy benefit and results in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Three of the four projects—BlueFire Ethanol, Inc., Poet, and Abengoa Bioenergy—will principally utilize biochemical processes to free the sugars from the biomass and then ferment them into alcohol. Range Fuels plans to use thermochemical processes to gasify the biomass into a "synthesis gas," which will then be further converted into biofuels.</p>
