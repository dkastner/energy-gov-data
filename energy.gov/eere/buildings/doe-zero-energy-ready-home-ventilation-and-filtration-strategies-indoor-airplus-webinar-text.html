<p><em>GoToWebinar voice:</em><br />The broadcast is now starting. All attendees are in listen-only mode.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Department of Energy Zero Energy Ready Home Technical Training Webinar Series. We're really excited that you can join us here today for this session on Indoor airPLUS Ventilation and Infiltration Strategies for Zero Energy Ready Home. I'm going to go ahead and get that first slide set up here. Today we have James Jackson and Nick Hurst of ICF International giving our presentation. My name's Lindsay Parker. I'm the coordination support for the program, and I'll be covering some general notes on webinar housekeeping. So everyone knows, everyone will be in listen-only mode, however, we invite you to ask any questions throughout the session in the questions part of the GoToWebinar program. We will be monitoring these questions throughout the webinar, so at the end of the webinar we'll try to cover as many of your questions as possible. The webinar will last about 40-45 minutes, then we'll have time at the end for Q and A. This session will be recorded, and so the recording will be placed on the Zero Energy Ready Home resources website. For this recording, it does take a little bit of time for transcriptioning, captioning, and to add it online. Please allow a couple weeks for that. However, in the meantime, so you're not left empty-handed, we also will be sending out a PDF of this presentation following the webinar, so that you have access to the slides. Additionally, there will be some information on our future upcoming webinars. Now I'm going to hand the reins over to Jamie Lyons with Newport Partners. He's our technical director for the Zero Energy Ready Home program.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Great; thank-you, Lindsay. Just a few quick words for me before we hand it over to our presenters today. Just to add a little bit of context. Over the last year, year and a half, we've had the privilege to work with builders and raters all around the country in introducing them to sort of the business, the marketing, and the technical concept of the Zero Energy Ready Home. So we typically do that as like a half-day session, in-person training. And we cover a lot of ground in that training, as you might imagine. And one of the areas where we often are requested to give a little more information is sort of the technical details of the envelope, of the HVAC, or in this case, of the indoor air quality package. That's sort of the genesis behind this webinar series. To do a little deeper dive into some of these technical topics and bring in experts to present the details. So with respect to indoor air quality, we have these things we call Zero Energy Ready Homes. Very, very efficient homes. They're well-insulated, they're well-air- sealed, so as we move into that space, these homes might be 2 ACH50, 3 ACH50, very well-air-sealed. We really need IAQ as a system, at that point. It's no longer something we sort of want to take for granted as extra credit. We have these homes so well-air-sealed, we need to look at things like good source control products. Obviously, these homes are so efficient, they're zero energy ready, we have good HVAC, we have high-efficiency HVAC. But in these homes, we also want that HVAC to provide comfort and also to do a really good job with indoor air quality with respect to things like infiltration, humidity control, ventilation. So that's what our presenters are going to talk a little bit about today. And that's the reason that the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home specification incorporates the Indoor airPLUS label as part of the spec. So we'll hear more about that today from both Nick Hurst and James Jackson. So before I turn it over to those guys, let me introduce them a little bit here.</p>
<p><em>First slide:</em><br />Nick -- Nick Hurst supports EPA's IAP program, Indoor airPLUS program, in the areas of partner engagement and technical support. Nick is a BPI building analyst, has a master of science and technology, with a concentration in building science. Previously, Nick has worked as a home builder, a remodeler, and an educator in both Pennyslvania and North Carolina, and now Nick serves a role at ICF coordinating a team of consultants that works with industry professionals in building and verifying Indoor airPLUS homes. And Nick is also going to be presenting today with James Jackson. James is also with ICF and provides technical support to the EPA ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup> Certified Homes program, as well as the IAP program. James is also a BPI building analyst and envelope professional, and a HERS rater. Prior to being at ICF, James worked in HVAC and construction industries, and was also the senior energy analyst for an electric utility in the South. He's now in Maryland and working to implement the ENERGY STAR new construction program in providing HVAC design trainings for utilities, as well. So with that, I'll turn it over to Nick and James. Take it away, guys.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Thank-you, Jamie, for the introduction, and Lindsay, for helping coordinate this. See if I can get my slide back up here in a second.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />It's been great to speak on the development of the Zero Energy Ready Home program and how it has brought high- performance homes, super-insulated and energy-efficient homes, into the fore, and also incorporated indoor air quality and water efficiency, as well. So we're happy to be here on behalf of the Indoor airPLUS program talking about some of those details. So thanks again. Lindsay, can you see our screen pretty well?</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />I can.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Great. We want to get a quick kind of show of hands, a demographic for who's on the call, so let's go ahead and run the first poll, just to kind of see who's out there right now.</p>
<p><em>Poll question:</em><br />We'd love to know what professions you're coming from, whether you're a builder, home energy rater, maybe a utility representative or HVAC contractor or other. So Lindsay will pull up that poll in a second.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Alright, we got it going. We'll leave this up here for a bit for people to send in their selections. ... Alright. That sounds great; I'm going to go ahead and close the poll. And show everyone the results.</p>
<p><em>Poll results:</em><br />So here we have, as your primary profession, we have 17 percent of folks who selected as a home builder, 32 percent are raters, 2 percent are HVAC contractors, 6 percent are utility representatives, and 42 percent are other.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Excellent. Great mix. Good to know, good to know. Well, there's certainly going to be a little bit of something for everyone. Let's go ahead and run the second poll right away, and we'll just get that out of the way.</p>
<p><em>Second poll question:</em><br />You can also let them know which of you are already partners in the Zero Energy Ready Home program or the Indoor airPLUS program. Two different separate partnerships, or maybe you're a partner in both, or neither. But just let us know.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Alright, the poll is up and running. Thank-you to everyone who is participating.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Yea, it's really helpful to get the little bit of a demographic for who's on the call, so this is very helpful.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Alright, great. Looks like most people participated. I'm going to go ahead and close the poll and share the results.</p>
<p><em>Second poll results:</em><br />Which are, 15 percent of folks who participated say that they're already Zero Energy Ready Home partners. And 9 percent are Indoor airPLUS partners. 18 percent are both. The majority, 53 percent, are neither. And 5 percent are not sure.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Alright, good to know. Well, we'll talk a little bit about partnership opportunities, too, after some of the technical portion of this, as well. So if you do want to utilize both the Indoor airPLUS label and the Zero Energy Ready Home label, you can do that, as well. See if I can get my slides up and running again ... There we are.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I'll give you just a quick rundown of what James and I will be discussing today. There's been some recent changes at Indoor airPLUS. The revision process kind of happens regularly. Revision 2 was released back in November, so we'll talk about some of the garage ventilation alternatives, in particular, that kind of came along with Revision 2 and how they relate to indoor air quality. And then James will talk primarily about HVAC, that section of the Indoor airPLUS spec, and design requirements for HVAC, how to handle humidity and moisture, and then some of the infiltration details in the spec, as well. And then we'll show you a few additional resources on the website, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Just for a very brief background about the relationship between Indoor airPLUS and ENERGY STAR: Indoor airPLUS and ENERGY STAR are separate programs, and you have separate partners that participate in each. Indoor airPLUS builds off of ENERGY STAR and all these kind of fundamental energy efficiency foundation that program has brought since the early to mid-'90s. All the envelope requirements, the HVAC requirements, the moisture management checklist that's a part of ENERGY STAR, for the builders who have been doing that, that all stays in place and is required for Indoor airPLUS. Indoor airPLUS kind of takes some of those and adds additional pieces to them. A number of the moisture management pieces that were specifically part of Indoor airPLUS from its inception have been brought into the ENERGY STAR checklist now. So if you're doing ENERGY STAR, you're pretty close probably on moisture management already. There are a few additional details for Indoor airPLUS. Some advanced features, as well, for HVAC and carbon monoxide are added to Indoor airPLUS. Three of the unique things there at the top of the list, in terms of radon, using radon-resistant construction techniques, some pest management techniques, as well, as well as a focus on materials and what we actually put into a home. So wrapping those all together kind of really creates a comprehensive indoor air quality package and some extra protections for the homeowner.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Three kind of key ways that we try to reduce health risks. We know we can't guarantee specific health outcomes for any one individual, but we know that we do have a pretty good prescriptive way to put together a home that does hopefully contribute to improved health for the occupants and improved indoor air quality over time. Source control is one of those, certainly making sure that we eliminate or manage any potentially harmful components that would be coming into the home. So that's that focus on materials that Indoor airPLUS has. And then ventilation would be a second strategy for reducing health risks and of course diluting the air, providing appropriate ventilation for the home. And then for those particulates and the things that still end up in our home, filtering them well, filtering them effectively, kind of the last stop. So a combination of all three of those items really kind of produces this outcome.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So Indoor airPLUS, as I mentioned, was revised in November 2013. And a couple of those key components of that revision were updates to the requirements for attached garages. So there's now no longer a firm requirement for a garage fan, for most houses. We'll get into that in a little bit. There's also another exception for aggregates for sand, which is a requirement under slabs, or had been a requirement under slabs. If you are still building in a Radon Zone 1, you are still required to have that extra cavity of aggregate under there for radon-resistant construction techniques. But there are some new exceptions for homes in dry climates. So you can see those in the specs, if you want to visit the website. In November also some changes happened to the partnership process and online database. It's now easier to join. If you're an ENERGY STAR partner, you can log into your My ENERGY STAR account, which you can see a screenshot of here. Go to EnergyStar.gov/mesa, and if you don't know your user name or password or have forgotten it from when you first signed up with ENERGY STAR, you can certainly email the ENERGY STAR Homes in-box or the Indoor airPLUS in-box, and an account rep can help you find that.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />But once you're back into your MESA account, there's tools and resources there. You can click on a link, and a couple clicks away join Indoor airPLUS, visit the partnership agreement, and sign the partnership agreement. It's very straightforward. And then there are some other tools such as Certified Homes co-brandable consumer brochure, some co-brandable banners. There's also all the ENERGY STAR and Indoor airPLUS logos that will be there once you sign your partnership agreement. And the Indoor airPLUS consumer brochure, which I'll mention a little bit later.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So diving into this construction spec, we'll do just a brief overview here of kind of how to use them. There are seven key sections to the spec dealing with moisture control, radon, all those elements that we just mentioned. You can see the screenshot on the right side of your screen there from the moisture control section. Each of the sections of the spec is broken out with the ENERGY STAR requirements that you're already meeting at the very top, so it says, "Note, completion of the ENERGY STAR checklist now satisfies these requirements." So you know you're doing those already. And then you can find the additional Indoor airPLUS requirements right below that. And again, there's always a couple sections, and occasionally some advisories, as well, for best practices throughout the spec. So when you first open the spec, you'll see the checklist, and it's a very simple one-page checklist. But we always encourage partners when they're looking at it for the first time: Don't just look at the checklist; certainly refer to the details in the spec for more detail.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So we're going to jump into Section 5.4 of the construction specifications, if you have them on hand. Again, this is kind of the one key update from the recent revision for attached garages. So I think everyone agrees that you run a little more risk of having pollutants enter the home when you have an attached garage versus a detached garage. So one of the kind of key ways to communicate that is isolation, certainly making sure that you have an effective, continuous air barrier across that garage-to- house interface, is one of those key aspects. EPA did a lot of kind of outreach with builders and home energy raters, home energy professionals around the country in the last year, and noticed some studies, as well, from Canada, for example, that really indicated that isolation is a key component of reducing that potential health risk. Some of those locations that might get missed, maybe around band joists or sill plates, connections to the foundation, or in this case, you see like a stem wall there, beside the garage slab. All those locations really should be air- sealed well. Also, something you don't see here is in the ceiling above this wall. There'll certainly be bays, floor joist bays, that need to be blocked and air-sealed effectively. And generally, the framer is responsible for that. Who does the air-sealing, it's kind of up to the builder. Sometimes it may be the framer, sometimes it may be the insulator. Sometimes it's the electrician who comes back and does that. But in any case, the rater should be the one who kind of puts the final set of eyes on that and inspect that air barrier. A couple other key components of isolation are making sure there's no HVAC equipment or ducts in the garage. James will have a couple other slides on that, showing that later. And making sure, of course, the door is weather-stripped. That's pretty standard to find a good weather-stripped door, entry door, nowadays. But also, adding a door closer for the walk-in door. So just keeping the door closed as often as possible. The kids are running in and out while maybe the mom turns the car on and had to go back in. We're trying to reduce the amount of potential carbon monoxide and fumes and exhaust from the garage entering the home. So again, isolation is the first strategy and then the appropriate ventilation strategy is next. In this case, now we're offering also a pressure- testing option that has been built into the program spec. So we'll talk about that here, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The main change that we see in Revision 2, when EPA looks closer at this, is geared toward how the whole-house ventilation system operates. Generally there's two kind of primary methods, or three. One is an exhaust-only ventilation strategy, typically where you use a bath fan on a timer to meet your ASHRAE 62.2 residential ventilation requirements. The other approach is the supply-only approach, where you're actually bringing in a dedicated supply, maybe it's to the return HVAC system. And then more advanced, would be like a balanced whole-house ventilation system, maybe an ERB or an HRV, something along those lines, as well. So all three of those strategies work. Maybe the more economical version is the exhaust-only version, but certainly when you're pulling a negative pressure on the home, in that case, there's a little bit more risk of potential contaminants from the garage entering the home. So in recognizing that, EPA is saying, if you have a supply-only or a balanced whole-house ventilation strategy, where you're actually pushing on the building envelope of the home, and pushing on that garage, you are reducing your risk for garage contaminants entering the home. You no longer have to use a garage exhaust fan in those cases. Now, if you do use the exhaust-only, whole- house ventilation strategy, there's a couple options you have. You can still use the 70 CFM exhaust fan or you can do a 45 Pascal pressure test to verify that the garage-to- house air barrier was substantially sealed.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So you see an image of that on this slide. And this is a very simple test for the rater to do while they're testing for whole-house infiltration. While they're running the blower doors negative 50, generally, they'd be inserting a small metal tube with their menometer across that pressure boundary, maybe under the door sweep of the walk-in door, and they verify that as 45 or greater. They're in essence saying that this garage is substantially more connected to outdoors than to indoors. So here you see a screenshot of the combustion pollutant section of the spec. There's three other items in there that we won't get into too much detail, related to having CO alarms and very specific emission standards for other space heating and fuel-burning equipment, as well. Some of those items can be built or verified throughout the spec, and some of them do need to be specifically rater verified, as well. But this focus on combustion pollutants in general and specifically the attached garage portion of that really provides homeowners with round-the-clock peace of mind for their family. Certainly something that the builder can also sell, the reduced exposure to carbon monoxide. Those are kind of the key components of what has gone into recent changes with regard to ventilation and particularly in garage ventilation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I'm going to turn things over to James for a little bit, and he's going to talk about Section 4, HVAC systems. He probably would rather be standing in front of an air handler doing this demonstration and discussion, but he'll grin and bear it and tell us a little bit about how to design a proper HVAC system.</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />Thanks, Nick. Hi, everyone. So today I'm going to be talking about something that's pretty near and dear to me, HVAC design. Something I enjoy and do on a day-to-day basis. And we're going to be talking a lot about how the Indoor airPLUS program aligns with ENERGY STAR and also where they don't quite meet -- where Indoor airPLUS actually takes a step above the Certified Homes program. And just kind of hone in on that and how to avoid pitfalls in the design process or even at testing. So one of the main things that Indoor airPLUS requires that's over ENERGY STAR Certified Homes is a requirement in humid climates to maintain 60 percent or less relative humidity. It's kind of obvious why -- anything higher than 60 percent can encourage mold growth and attract pests. It's just not healthy.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So we're going to talk about different ways to control the relative humidity below 60 percent. And then, where we place our equipment: in garages. I think pretty much everybody can think of houses they've gone into and seen ducts in spaces where they really don't belong. Air handlers in garages or utility rooms where they store gasoline or oil or paint. For example, my parents' house. I even found paint cans in their return duct because of where it was located; it was just kind of an easy place for them to store stuff. And my dad just so happens to suffer from some allergies. So it's kind of a no-brainer to get that stuff out of there.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />OK, so, in the Certified Homes program, and as required by code in most places now in America, we're wanting to see proper sizing by the use of ACCA Manual J or the ASHRAE Handbooks.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And in warm, humid climates, the system must be installed with sufficient capacity to reduce the relative humidity below 60 percent. And we're definitely going to dig into that and one of the different methods you can use to control that, as well as Manual S. Right here you'll see a screenshot of Table 1A in Manual J. And this table is full of all kinds of fantastic data when you're designing a system on a house in specific climates. There's pretty much every city, sometimes even small towns, depending on the geographics of the state that's located in this table. And typically even if you do Manual J, you might never see this table because all of this data is loaded into the software that we're required to use. But I feel it's really important to see what data is there and where it comes from. If you notice the arrow is pointing at the design grain, and it's at 50 percent relative humidity. And that's basically telling the practitioner the moisture pressure difference between inside and out, so just like you'll see your cooling dropoff, which is the temperature that you designed the system to, there's also moisture designs, as well. So you can make sure that on a design day, that equipment can handle the latent load or the moisture load of the home.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, so this is kind of a no-brainer, but it's worth mentioning. It's kind of like a water pump or a sump pump. It has to be on to move water, right? Well, an air- conditioning is pumping heat. That's what it's doing. It's extracting heat from inside and pulling it outside. So the system must run to actually do its job. So right-sizing is a key in controlling relative humidity in the structure. So it's important to ensure that the system is not only right-sized but it runs long enough. And we're going to talk about that on the next slide. So Manual S is kind of the next step in the design process. First you get a good load calculation on the house, find out how much heat is entering a structure during the summer, and how much heat is leaving the structure in the winter. So Manual S helps you select your heating and cooling equipment for the load. And it's incredibly important as it relates to the moisture load on a home. HVAC systems have a broad range of capabilities depending on how they're commissioned and how they're matched up, and the controls that are useful. And to satisfy the 60 percent or less requirement of Indoor airPLUS, you have to actually control the relative humidity in the house with a humidistat or possibly even stand-alone dehumidifier in extreme climates. This will typically happen in climates that have high humidity during the shoulder seasons, or a lot of mild weather with really high humidity where the indoor relative humidity can climb above 60 percent.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />OK, right here is a IECC climate zone map. And that line shows you where the humidity starts basically in the country. And I'm from below that line, so I'm very familiar with the woes of trying to carry latent load in a house and what can happen in homes that are oversized or the system is not designed properly and it doesn't remove the moisture. It can cause tremendous issues, especially with indoor air quality. So that's kind of one of the harping points of Indoor airPLUS.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, this is another snapshot that you probably won't see, even if you do a lot of HVAC design. And Manual S is basically the procedure to help a practitioner get through this worksheet, or the engineering data sheet. This specific one is for a three-ton air conditioning. And if you notice the highlighted fields are showing that you've got an entering wet-ball temperature of 63 degrees, and an entering dry-ball temperature of 75 degrees, with an ambient temperature of 95. So basically, that's saying that it's 95 degrees outside, and you've got 50 percent relative humidity on the inside. Now the red box around .83 is what's considered the ST ratio. So that's sensible to total capacity ratio. So that tells the practitioner how much sensible heat is being removed, versus how much latent heat is being removed, and it's very important to make sure that you hit both of those. The total design capacity of this specific system and these parameters is 33,200 Btu/h. And that speaks volumes to me, as well, because we know a three-ton unit should be moving 36,000 Btu/h. But that's not always the case. There's a lot that goes on with HVAC design, and there's three-ton under different conditions that can carry that 36,000 Btu/h load.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So this is a little summary of what we've already covered in this specific section. The design must be rater certified -- or verified. And the rater should really verify the documentation before the start of construction. If there's anything that doesn't quite match up or they're not controlling the relative humidity or maybe the Manual S isn't quite right, you really want your builder to know before construction. And all the stuff that we've covered is really in the Certified Homes program, with the exception of the 60 percent or less relative humidity. Alright, the next thing we're going to talk about is duct system design and installation, which is, I think we can all agree, very important. It's great if you have a system that's sized right, and you select the right equipment, but without proper air distribution and good, tight ducts, you can actually cause more problems, or decrease the system's ability to remove the heat. So all the ducts, just like in the Certified Homes program, must be designed to Manual D or ASHRAE Handbooks. And all the systems must be airtight and properly balanced. In Indoor airPLUS, you cannot use building cavities as part of the forced-air supply or return systems. We're going to talk a little bit about why we're concerned about that. And also, we require the ducts to be covered throughout construction, or the ducts are cleaned out prior to the installation of the registers or terminals.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, here's some illustrations of what ducts look like when they're covered up during the construction process. The picture on the left is overhead ceiling boots, but a lot of it is comb with that cardboard plug that you can get. And you can also buy those separately. The next one is my favorite. I test a lot of duct systems, and it is so much easier to go into a house and test the duct system if it's done like this. The boots are mastic taped to the floor, so you don't have to tape up the duct systems on a rough duct -- the ducts are nice and clean when you uncover them, and it really speeds up the process. So there's an inherent benefit to that, outside of just keeping a good clean duct system. Also, I'm sure that this slide probably brings to mind houses that you've seen in the past, existing or new construction, where you look down and find just awful stuff in the ducts, that has fallen down, and there are bugs and construction debris. I have a 2-year-old at my house who loves to throw Cheerios down the ducts. So that's fun. The other pictures here is showing someone's ceiling joints with mastic. That's another requirement in the ENERGY STAR Certified Homes program, and the mastic must be UL-181 listed and installed according to code.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, here is an illustration of a joist bay being used as a return duct. While you can get this to pass a duct tightness test in new construction, if you think about it, there's always something changing in the house. The moisture levels, the temperature of the air going through that space. So these materials, they'll expand and contract quite a bit. And typically, not too awfully long after the house is built, you can actually see the cracks start forming in the mastic or any kind of the ceiling method that you used. And it can easily introduce harmful air into the duct system and distribute it throughout the home. So this is a very important part of the spec to me.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The next image is a wall chase for a return air duct. And this is kind of standard up north, what you see a lot for a heating-dominant climate. But once again, if you're not really careful, or even over time with that warm air traveling through that space, the other material will expand and contract.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, so this is a quick summary of what we just talked about. This can be builder or rater verified, so if you find something that needs to be addressed in the field, this is an item that can be builder verified after they make the corrections. The best time to verify everything in the duct system design and installation part of the spec is during the pre-drywall inspection, where you can actually put your eyes on everything and make sure that it's all as designed. And then verify, take a quick walk through the house. Verify that the ducts were all covered during construction or that they're thoroughly cleaned out when you come back for your final inspection.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, so 4.3 is the location of air handlers and ducts. This illustration I see pretty much daily in new construction. It's where they have run a conditioned air duct in a bulkhead in the garage to try to get the air into that space above the garage, whether it be a bedroom above the garage or the bonus room above the garage. And it is going to become more prominent as we start moving our ducts into conditioned space, because you won't be able to run that supply duct up and over into the attic space. This is absolutely fine. You just have to make sure that you have a continuous air barrier to separate that potentially contaminated air with the space that the duct is running through. So just bear in mind, it's OK, but it has to have a continuous air barrier.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />This is what the requirement on 4.3 looks like. If you notice, this is a rare verified item, so it's something that you have to make sure that you verify during your pre-drywall and also at final, if there's an air barrier like the drywall is your air barrier.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />OK, mechanical whole-house ventilation, ASHRAE 62.2. We have to do this in certified homes, and a lot of codes are requiring it now. But it's very important to take note of one thing. There's an advisory here that says outdoor air ducts connected to the return side should be used as supply ventilation only if it meets the manufacturer's requirements for return air temperature. Basically, what that means is if you introduce very warm humid air into a duct system and the equipment can't handle it, or it's outside of the manufacturer's requirements for the return air temperature, you can have problems on the cooling side. And I've seen this come up a lot more as it relates to heat pump operation. If you blow cold air into a return on a heat pump system, the heat pump will not perform. You'll have immediate comfort complaints, and it'll also drive up the electric consumption, as the heat pump won't be able to carry the load. It changes the physics that's happening inside of the system and it can cause a big problem. And also the ventilation must be tested and verified.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, here's three illustrations of whole-house ventilation. This is pretty much everything but an ARV. ARV isn't really a whole lot to look at. It's just a big box with ducts attached to it. What we have on the far left- hand side is a fresh air damper that's on a control that's usually -- either has a fan inside of it or it's controlled by the air handler or it controls the air handler, rather, to introduce fresh air into the return side. The image in the middle is an exhaust fan. Nick talked about this a little bit ago. This is probably the most cost-effective way to do it. In humid climates, it can cause some issues, though, so return only or negative ventilation is kind of a tricky thing in that Southern, humid climate. But these bath fans are usually on timers and occupancy sensors that are set up after the calculation for the house is done, to find out what the intermittent ventilation needs to be. On the far right, you have a return duct, and it has continuous fresh air, so these are usually controlled by timers on the air handlers themselves. So every time the air handler is running, it's introducing a muted amount of fresh air into the system and distributing it. OK, so filtration. One thing of note: Access panels have to be filled with gasketed materials. We typically can't pass a duct tightness test if this is not done. But it's pretty important that none of the air bypasses the filter. So this area on the duct system has to be gasket. So another requirement in Indoor airPLUS is a MERV 8 or higher filter. And you cannot install any air cleaning equipment like an electronic air cleaner with any kind of ozone production. Ozone is a lung irritant, and especially in these tighter homes it's kind of a bad idea to introduce ozone into the home. I promised when we kicked this thing off that I would help you navigate around some possible issues, and this is probably one of the biggest things as it relates to design to me. If you put a MERV 8 filter in a duct system, you can cause some tremendous issues if it's not well-thought-out. So MERV 8s pick up a lot more particulates than the other filters, so the media has to be a lot more dense. And with the denser media, you have to expect some more restrictions. It's very important to account for these type of filters in your duct design. And it has to be accounted for in the pressure loss on the duct design. If it's ignored you can create additional noise and tremendous airflow problems and exceed the equipment's ability to even move air. So it's a pretty important point.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />This is a performance chart showing the restrictions for different filter thicknesses. A lot of times we'll just put a one-inch filter in the bottom of a furnace or an air handler. But if you notice on this chart, the difference between a four-inch and a one-inch filter at high speed is almost 40 percent. So if you're dealing with a duct design that's particularly challenging because of the available static pressure to actually distribute the air, you might have shot your entire budget for static pressure just on the filter. And another thing to think about: With the increased performance of the homes that we're building in the ENERGY STAR Certified Homes and Challenge Homes program, we have smaller HVAC systems, pushing air farther with smaller blowers. So the restrictions on the duct system actually have greater implications than they ever have.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, so here is basically the summary for 4.7, filtration. It can be builder or rater verified. You definitely need to coordinate this item with the builder and the HVAC contractor before the start of construction to ensure that they're using the proper filter and they're designing the proper filter, and that they're not using any kind of ozone-producing air cleaning equipment. And then when you come in at final, it's always a good idea to visually inspect the filter and make sure that they've used the right one. And with that, I am going to pass it back off to Nick to do a summary of Section 4.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Great, James. It's great to see some of the details. As you can see, there's only four items that are kind of above and beyond ENERGY STAR in this section. Depending on where you're building, you may have more requirements than other places. But these kind of simple steps and a little bit of extra thought in the process really provide the homeowner with some additional benefits that you can sell. Increased comfort, certainly reduced exposure to potential mold and mildew, and help them to remove potential allergens, irritants, etc. I think upselling on an increased filtration and improved HVAC system is certainly valuable to the customer.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Just quickly, we'll talk a little bit about some of the resources and tools or other technical guidance you can find. You can see the Indoor airPLUS website there at the bottom of your screen. And I think these slides will be sent out later on so you can have all these links, as well. But there you can find the construction requirements, recorded webinars from the past, YouTube videos, as well. And then there's a bunch of marketing materials, website widgets, if you want to use those as a partner. And the free brochure that you can get at EPA to send you directly, as well. One of the newer marketing resources is the co- brandable consumer brochure. As I mentioned, this is available in your MyEnergyStar account. Go to EnergyStar.gov/mesa. When you join and you have access to this, you can download it and include your own image, your own logo, in a box on the front, as well as fill out the text boxes to provide more detail about your company, to be able to sell Indoor airPLUS to your customers.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The inside of this is very full-color brochure that kind of shows the seven different aspects of the construction specifications and those key bullet points that you'll want to convey or want to have your sales team, if you're a builder, convey to the homebuyer.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another thing to note is the Indoor airPLUS Leader Awards, which were just recently released, last month. So for the first year, Indoor airPLUS gave awards to builders as well as raters. Foxwood Builders, Palo Duro Homes, C&amp;B Construction. We're excited to have them building Indoor airPLUS homes and some of the raters, as well, who won the award. You can visit that link at the bottom to read more about the Indoor airPLUS Leader Awards and certainly watch for announcements to apply for the 2015 award, which will likely be released late winter sometime of this coming year. Also be on the lookout for DOE's Housing Innovation Awards for Zero Energy Ready Home partners. These will be announced as I understand at the EEBA conference coming up in St. Louis. Jamie might have more detail on that, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />But some other additional resources and tools that you should definitely visit are the Building America Solution Center website. You see the link there for that tool. Tons of great resources here. It's really become a storehouse for all kinds of building science details. For ENERGY STAR, for Zero Energy Ready Homes -- there's a module there now. There's also going to be more dedicated modules for Indoor airPlus, as well. So there will be more stuff continuing to be submitted and posted here. And please consider submitting images and content yourself. If you have great building science images or some additional content, there is a way to do that. See that link at the bottom of your screen for the submission criteria.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So that's a brief look at HVAC, ventilation strategies with Indoor airPLUS and how they plug into Zero Energy Ready Home. We'd be happy to take some questions at this point, Lindsay, if any have come in. And we're certainly available to contact afterward. You can email the Indoor airPLUS team there, to answer any questions that don't get answered today.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Great. This is Jamie Lyons. I'll jump in here and review a few of the questions. Thank-you for typing them in, by the way. We've gotten a number. A few we just answered privately to the person asking the question. But let's go through several others. First off, we have one regarding the automatic door closer on the house garage door. The question is whether the door needs to fully close or is the presence of a closer enough?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Well, that's a great question. I would think that the intent of the spec is to have the door close as fully as possible. There is not a requirement, however, to verify that it completely shuts the door. So if the concern is, you know, does it get hung up at all, a little bit, the answer is no. It does not have to be verified to shut the door and latch it completely.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />I would think most homeowners would appreciate a door that does fully close as it's supposed to.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Right. Good question, though.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Here's one that we went ahead and answered, but I'll just review it for the benefit of the group. So this is getting back to the need for an exhaust fan out of the garage, the garage exhaust fan. The question was, what if an air cycler is being used to meet the home's ventilation requirements? Do you still need separate garage exhaust, and our response was, no you don't. So the garage exhaust fan spec only applies in scenarios where the home is actually using an exhaust-only whole-house mechanical ventilation system and the air cycler being a supply-side type solution. So in that case, the requirement for the garage exhaust fan would not apply. Anything to add to that, Nick or James?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />No, I think that's a great response, Jamie. I think that really does cover it. Yea. If the air cycler is simply supplying fresh air on the supply side, or I'm sorry, maybe into the ductwork, whether it's the return part of the plenum as long as it takes the supply-only ventilation strategy, then you wouldn't need the garage fan.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Thanks. Here's one -- I think it was around the time you were discussing not using building cavities as supply or return ducts, as one of the provisions in the HVAC section. The question is, do you have any issues using wall cavities as jumper ducts or transfer ducts, to relieve pressure?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />No, it's OK to use wall cavities as jumper ducts. There's nothing specific in the Indoor airPLUS requirements that prohibits that.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. That certainly is one of the cases where relieving the pressure out of a closed-off bedroom, for example, is a very good thing for balancing and comfort and even temperatures throughout the house.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />That's correct. And there's a few different ways to do that. But yea, oftentimes -- sometimes a door cutout or a manufactured product in the door works, but it can be an extra expense. Certainly just kind of leaving a hole above the door with an upside-down vent, grills, is another way to do that pressure balancing.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Moving on, this is one regarding I think James' discussion on the higher pressure drops that you get with the higher MERV filters. The question being, what are some strategies to best manage pressure restrictions that can come with thicker, more effective filters, without stressing the HVAC system / increasing energy use / decreasing operating life?</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />Well, a lot of times you'll see the MERV 8 filters -- the one-inch -- will have such a high pressure drop across it, that just simply putting in a four-inch media cabinet will alleviate a lot of the pressure drop. And make sure that if there is room for additional return ducts to allow air to get back to the system. That's also a really good idea. A lot of the systems, especially after they get above three ton, there are knockouts on either side, as a system, if it's upright. So you can actually utilize a knockout on both sides of the system and run two separate return air ducts to try to alleviate the pressure. If the pressure drops, the fan doesn't have to labor as hard to move the air, so you'll get some energy savings there.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />It may be counterintuitive to some that the four-inch media filter actually is less-restrictive than what looks like a smaller or less substantial filter than the one-inch.</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />There's a tremendous amount of surface area on the four- inch filters versus the one-inch filters, so in some of my classroom trainings I'll actually open up one of the those filters and have someone stretch it across the class. The illustration that I showed with the filter that's not in a cardboard frame, it's actually about as long as a typical classroom, so 25, 30 feet long, when you stretch it all out, outside of its frame.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Another really good practice we've seen that is I believe a code requirement in California is to label the ductwork near the filter location as to the pressure drop that the system has been designed for, so when that filter is replaced, subsequently over time, that the homeowner has the best chance possible to put in appropriate filter and not accidentally increase the pressure drop and compromise the system.</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />OK. That's a great point. Thank-you.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Here's one on the 60 percent relative humidity requirement. How exactly does the rater verify that the 60 percent design requirement has been met? Where should I look for this in the design docs?</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />Well, the options in Manual J are 55, 50, and 45 percent. And that should be listed in your summary page. The other items is making sure that there's a humidistat installed, and inside that humidistat you can actually look in the installer's part of the humidistat control and see what the relative humidity is set at. Basically, what a humidistat does, it will bring on the condensing unit and have the fan running at a slower speed to allow that air to spend more time across the evaporator pool and remove more moisture. It does drop the temperature in the house a little bit, but it removes moisture as it runs.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />And again, that requirement would only be in those high- humid climate as noted by the IECC climate zone map. So there's a white line.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />And James, just to clarify your first point on a verification possibility, there's Manual J documentation that can serve as adequate verification of this RH requirement being met?</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />No, that's just basically saying that it was actually accounted for in the design. Where it is actually met with the additional dehumidification equipment, if it cannot be met through -- like if the load cannot be met through the Manual S, it can be met through additional dehumidification or humidistat controls. That's just a good place to look for the intended design, whether it's 55, 50, or 45 percent.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Let's jump back to the garage. In homes that we require a garage exhaust fan, does it need to have any timing controls? Is there a minimum run time?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />There was -- yes, that's a great question. If the home does have an exhaust-only whole-house ventilation strategy, and they're using the exhaust fan, it should either be wired for continuous operation or whenever the garage is occupied it should operate; it can come off of a motion detector or a switch, for at least one hour after the garage has been vacated.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Is that spelled out in the spec under 5.4, right?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />That's correct. Yea. Very good question.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Here's one on incremental costs. What's the cost to implement Indoor airPLUS compared to a 2009 code-compliant home? Please include materials and the added cost for the rater.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />So the question is on the additional cost above and beyond like a 2009 code-compliant home?</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />That's right, yea.</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />Yea, it certainly will vary, not only kind of based on code, depending on where you're at, but based on your local climate zone and your radon zone, as well. So if you are in a hot humid climate, there's going to be some more items that you're going to have to do. If you're in a drier climate, if you're working in the Southwest, potentially, there are some more exceptions to some of the requirements in the spec. If you're in Radon Zone 1, you're going to need to do radon new construction techniques, which include, you know, the aggregate under the slab, as well as the passive radon vent. If you're in Radon Zone 2 or 3, those are not required. They're certainly advised, very simple assurance. Radon comes up everywhere. But to get to the long and short of your question, it really does depend on a lot of those factors, and it can be anywhere from 500 bucks to maybe $3,000 above and beyond kind of your standard practice, depending on what you're doing locally, you know, and how stringent your local codes are, and of course those other climate factors.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Ok. Here's a question on a provision that is not included in IAP. Why would IAP not require HVAC equipment to be installed in the conditioned space?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />It's a very good question. I think that it's probably been challenging for some builders to get to that point. Certainly there's logistics in terms of framing and house design in general that need to be addressed. It's something I don't think that EPA has looked at closely, in terms of potential policy record updates. But it's a good question, if you wouldn't mind writing in about it, and we can maybe discuss more detail offline, and that'd be helpful.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />And just an add-on from the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home perspective: Ductwork as well as the HVAC does need to be located in conditioned space, and I guess you can look it up, all these provisions on a continuum of the difficulty and the cost of implementation versus the performance benefit that's received. So DOE weighed that one, especially the aspect of getting the ducts in conditioned space. Once you do that, oftentimes the HVAC equipment kind of follows along. And in DOE's estimation, looking at that for homes that we're labeling as Zero Energy Ready Homes, that was one of the key provisions to include in the mandatory requirements. But as Nick said, it can be challenging depending on the foundation style and the location in the country</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />It is one of the great aspects that the Zero Energy Ready Home program is really pushing in the marketplace, is getting builders and designers to rethink their strategies. From the indoor air quality perspective, it may not be quite as important, but there certainly still are some merits to that, as well. But it's definitely viable from the energy efficiency standpoint.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Here's sort of a programmatic one. Are there homes out there that are on the Indoor airPLUS label without also earning the ENERGY STAR label? Is the Indoor airPLUS an add-on to ENERGY STAR?</p>
<p><em>Nick Hurst:</em><br />It is an add-on. All the ENERGY STAR checklists and verification checklists do need to be completed. We get that question from time to time from folks who do want an indoor air quality label. But EPA feels strongly that the ENERGY STAR kind of foundation for energy efficiency, HVAC design and installation, moisture management, is really a strong foundation to build on. So it is still a requirement in the program.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Let's take a couple more. We're just about up against our time limit. If you are using a MERV 8 filter within the ERV, would you still need a MERV 8 filter in the central system?</p>
<p><em>James Jackson:</em><br />Yes, the ERV is just moving a small amount of the air that's actually in the house, and the air handling equipment exchanges it all. So yes, you would have to use a MERV 8 filter still.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Thanks for all the great questions. There was a number we did not have time to get to today, but I'm sure if you reach out to either the Indoor airPLUS team or Lindsay Parker, who will give us our closing words here in a minute, we can get you responses to questions that you're really interested in. Lindsay, do you want to take back the reins and close it up? And I know there's been a number of questions about availability of the slides.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:<br />Next slide:</em><br />OK, I'm taking over the reins ... There we go. You can see our resources slide. So here we have ... Thank-you, everyone, for joining us today, and thanks so much for Nick and James for a great presentation, really informative, and I hope everyone had most of their questions answered. Again, for Zero Energy Ready Home resources page, we provide plenty of information on there, as well as the recorded webinar, which as I said previously, takes some time for transcription and getting on the YouTube page. So that will be available online on our resources site in a couple of weeks. Traditionally, right after the webinar, I'll be sending out a PDF of the presentation so everyone can get a view of the slides. There is the website for our resources for Zero Energy Ready Home program. It's <a href="http://www.buildings.energy.gov/zero">www.buildings.energy.gov/zero</a>. And there you can find upcoming events for trainings, any kind of conference presentations that we have, as well as more of our webinars. There you can see where our partners are located throughout the country and program specifications. Additionally, we like to plug the website for our Building America Solution Center, which provides even more helpful information. So ... let's see, next slide ...</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />If you do want to reach out to us, again, via email, you can either email me at <a href="mailto:lparker@energetics.com">lparker@energetics.com</a> or <a href="mailto:DOEChallengeHome@newportpartnersllc.com">DOEChallengeHome@newportpartnersllc.com</a>.
