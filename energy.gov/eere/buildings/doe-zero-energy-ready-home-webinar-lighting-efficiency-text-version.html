<p><em>Alex Krowka:<br />Presentation cover slide:</em><br />... join us today for this session on LED lighting design for Zero Energy Ready Homes, to be presented by Brooke Silber of Jan &amp; Brooke Luminae and David Brignati of Newport Ventures. Today's session is one in a continuing series of technical training webinars to support our partners in designing and building DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes. My name is Alex Krowka. I'm from Energetics Incorporated, and I just have some general notes on webinar housekeeping. First off, we encourage attendees to use a hard-wired broadband Internet connection, if possible, to help keep up with the slides. Sometimes people's wi-fi connections get a little spotty, so it's better to be hard-wired in. All attendees will be in listen-only mode, however, we do invite you to type in your questions throughout the session in the questions section of the GoToWebinar tool. We'll monitor these throughout the webinar, and near the end of the webinar, we'll try to cover as many of them as possible. This session is being recorded and will be placed on the "Resources" page of the Zero Energy Ready Home website. Please allow some time for this, because it does take a couple of days to go through the process of being added online. Also, after the webinar we'll send out an email with a PDF of the presentation and some information on our upcoming webinars. Now I'm going to hand it over to Jamie Lyons, technical director of the Zero Energy Ready Home program. ... Hi, Jamie?</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />... Oh, that's much better. Thank-you, Alex. Hopefully everybody heard that educational dissertation I just gave. But I'll repeat it! Welcome. Thanks for joining us today. Hopefully that will be our first and last hiccup. I'm just going to frame the topic of lighting efficiency a little bit, for the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program.</p>
<p><em>First slide:</em><br />So as we get started here today, I just want to, for perspective, look at the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home specs. And as the name implies, the goal of this program and the homes and builders that we work with is to get homes to that place where they're zero energy ready: With a reasonably sized renewable system, they can get into that neighborhood of zero energy performance. Along those lines, we want to diminish and reduce the loads in the home, and lighting and appliances are a big part of that. As we work on the heating and cooling, water heating loads, lighting and appliances become more and more evident as an area to focus, to continue to reduce loads to reasonable and manageable levels. So under the specs, we have a set of mandatory requirements. And the one which deals with lighting looks for 80 percent of the lighting fixtures to be ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup>-qualified, or the lamps themselves to be ENERGY STAR-qualified in 80 percent of the sockets. So a couple things to note about that spec. First off, it doesn't require LEDs. It simply requires ENERGY STAR-qualified lighting, which doesn't necessarily have to be LEDs. And secondly, we're not just quoting like a lumens per watt kind of efficiency spec; we're looking to the ENERGY STAR label. And that's notable because one of the main themes of the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program is that it definitely involves high-efficiency, energy-efficient homes that can get to zero with some renewables. But it also -- you know, a really key pillar is the performance of these homes. These are high-performance homes that are energy efficient. So they have good indoor air quality. They have good moisture management. They have good comfort for the residents. And hopefully the lighting also follows suit, that it's not just high-efficiency, but the performance is also up to par and leaves residents satisfied and happy with their indoor lighting environment. So that's part of the reason that the program points to the ENERGY STAR specifications for high-efficiency lighting.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So today we'll be hearing a lot about the use of LEDs in high-performance homes. It's really based on practical experience from both Brooke and David, who have a lot of current, relevant experience with residential projects involving LEDs. We see more and more LEDs in the DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes that are coming in to DOE. But like any new technology, they have different technical characteristics and attributes, so that means differences in the design process. It also means differences in building integration and even consumer understanding of what these things are, how they work, and how to interact with them. So Brooke and David respectively will tackle those topics. And if we do them well and do them right, at the end of the day, the user experience really should be different. It should be a high-performance, high-efficiency lighting technology that they enjoy having in their home. So that's the end goal. Alex, want to launch that first poll? So I'm going to hand off over the baton here to Brooke Silber, while I read her bio for everybody, to introduce her.</p>
<p><em>Poll question slide ("Please describe your role in the building industry"):</em><br />I'm going to ask Alex to launch the first poll, just to get a little bit of an idea about who's on the session today. And Alex, once you have a little bit of time for people to respond, you can show the results. In the meantime, I'll introduce Brooke. Brooke Silber: In 2014, Jan Moyer and Brooke Silber founded the lighting design firm Jan &amp; Brooke Luminae. Brooke's current projects include multiple videoconferencing facilities for the Coast Guard group, as well as interior and exterior lighting for high-end residences and hotels.</p>
<p><em>Poll results slide:</em><br />Before partnering with Jan, Brooke was a senior associate at Domingo Gonzalez Associates, where her projects included the award-winning New York State Capitol and the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse. She teaches at Parsons The New School for design, and is also the co-chair of the Joint IES Infocomm Lighting for Videoconferencing and Multimedia Committee. Brooke received a bachelor of fine arts from Syracuse in interior design and a master's of science in lighting from Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p><em>Alex Krowka:</em><br />For anyone who can't see the poll results, it looks like 7 percent of our attendees are builders, 30 percent are energy raters or consultants, 20 percent architects, 3 percent manufacturers, and 40 percent other.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Thanks for that perspective, Alex. You want to run the second poll real quick, as I hand it over to Brooke?</p>
<p><em>Poll question slide ("Have you been involved in a residential project featuring LED lighting in several applications?"):</em><br />Now if you could recap the poll results when they're up, that'd be great.</p>
<p><em>Alex Krowka:<br />Poll results slide:</em><br />So it looks like 72 percent of our attendees have been involved in a residential project featuring LED lighting, and 28 percent have not.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. All yours, Brooke. Are you unmuted and able to go?</p>
<p><em>Brooke Silber:</em><br />I'm here. Thank-you so much for the introduction, Jamie. So, welcome. Hopefully I'll provide you with some useful information today. I'm going to talk about designing with LEDs, specifically for residential projects. The design process --</p>
<p><em>Alex Krowka:</em><br />Brooke, sorry to interrupt. Just make sure that you press the "show your screen" button.</p>
<p><em>Brooke Silber:</em><br />It is pressed. You're not seeing it?</p>
<p><em>Alex Krowka:</em><br />I'm not. How about you, Jamie?</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />No, I'm not seeing it yet, either. You're running the slide show, after showing your screen?</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />-- There you go.</p>
<p><em>Brooke Silber:</em><br />OK, great. So the design process -- and this is a quote from a mentor of mine back in 2002, and he commented -- the design process is neither linear nor sequential. It's kind of like random, strange board games. You kind of go three steps forward, then you go backward, and you have more questions, and then you might go jump forward, and you might go back. And sometimes it just feels like completely a mess, and then all of a sudden it's pulled together. Every time you work on a project, you get better and better each time. And there's never been a time where this is more true than working with LEDs.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />LEDs have definitely made our life more complicated. So when asked to do this, I looked at, well, what's going to be helpful? So I thought, well, let me think about how we determine when and where and which LEDs we use. And you kind of see that you start to think about -- oh, all those energy codes. I've got state codes; I've got local codes. I've got the inspectors. I've got my client asking me, do I do a payback analysis? And then I think about all the applications in the home and the different rooms and the way they use them, and the tasks, and then the equipment that might support that. And then you get into the photometrics like the output and the distribution and all this data that's being provided. And then you've also got to think about all the controls and the compatibility associated with the lighting fixture that you chose and what the control is. And you've also got to think about the color and how it looks, because ultimately we all want to look good, especially in our own home, when we're standing in front of our mirror getting ready to go out to a dinner date with our husband or wife or significant other. So when I put all this together, I realized wow, it almost looks like a mess. But you know, sometimes when you're making spaghetti, it looks like a mess, but oh, isn't it so good when you're all done?</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I kind of liken this to spaghetti. We're going to make some spaghetti today. So how do we determine when and which LEDs to use? If we go with the idea here today that we're either being asked to do it from an energy standpoint or we're choosing to do it from an energy standpoint, so we're going to deal with all the codes and so forth. Let's jump right into the idea of, OK, the client has requested this. And sometimes they know why they've requested it, and sometimes they're not sure; it's just because of the energy, or because it's new, or they just want to know. So often we'll start with maybe looking at a payback analysis for them.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />In this particular interior residence over on Long Island, we started with a very basic sort of analysis on, well, let's look at, if we've got this large space, if we've got a total number of fixtures in the house of 220, I'm going to use a downlight just to even out a recessed downlight, just to kind of even out the quantity of fixtures. So if I used an MR-16 pipe housing, and I used something that's sort of midrange -- not the low range, not the high range, because we all know we can get prices all over the board, even for a simple MR-16 with a socket downlight -- we might have a fixture, DN fixture cost of $180. And we have a distributor markup, and we've got electrical contract markup. Does seem reasonable. And then let's say we have the cost of the lamp. In this case, I'm going to use it as if we were using a MR-16 LED retrofit lamp. And I'm comparing this against an integral LED. So the integral LEDs are going to have quite a bit more initial cost. And of course, that's carried through with the distributor markup and the electrical con markup. Now I don't have a lamp, but I still end up with a cost differential of those total number of fixtures of not quite double. So if I stayed with, and this is what often some people do, is they're like, well, what happens if I just want to do the electric fences, but I still want to do LEDs? That's why we look at the expenses of LED retrofit. Then the question is, well, the lamp is really expensive; what kind of a savings am I going to have on energy? So that's the next analysis we might run for them. And this is looking at the same project and analyzing it against the halogen, the MR-16 LED replacement, and an integral module. Now, a halogen, we know we can go all the way up to a 50-watt lamp, but even today that's not worth it. We usually stay with a 37-watt or under. So I've based our calculations on that. With a $220 lamp, that gives us a total load effect of 8,140 watts. And if I'm operating that at most eight hours a day -- you have to remember, a lot of us are gone during the day, and at work and doing other things, so we don't tend to operate every room in eight hours a day, so this is absolutely the high end of the spectrum looking at the hours that you're in the house and using it. Let's say that this is a weekend day. And then we look at the MR-16 replacement lamp, and at about 10.5 watts, and I used an integral module. They come in slightly varying wattages, but I used a fairly typical 13 watts to run this analysis. And in running this analysis, what we see is that there is about a savings of somewhere around $15, $16 a day, by using the MR-16 replacement lamp. And that gets us -- if we're only looking at LED replacement lamps -- that gets us an anticipated payback cycle of 1.4 years. So doing that lamp may be very much worth your client's time and money. However, using an integral module gives you 8.8 years. So at that point, you really ask the owner, the client, is this worth it? Or you ask yourself, as a builder, is this worth that energy? And sometimes it definitely may be.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />After looking at whether we want to consider an LED, then we start and look at the applications in which LEDs really enhance our lives, enhance our choices, versus sometimes where we may not want to make the choice of an LED.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So, first thing to establish those various areas, those various applications, is to establish a project lighting objective with the owner. It's about getting to know the owner. It's about -- I mean, sometimes you're asking incredibly personal questions on some of these things, such as, how do you shave your legs? Do you shave it in the shower? Do you shave it out of the shower? Or, do you guys read in bed at night? Do you watch television in bed at night? Those are some of the questions that you start to ask people. You're really literally in their life to try and understand how they use their home. And those can help determine some of your objectives.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Within that, you're always considering things like visibility. The whole -- how everything is put together in the house. How things relate to one another. Do the color temperatures match? Do the intensities feel correct and balanced? And that gets you into sort of a composition of brights and relationships between certain surfaces and objects. We're always looking to understand the style or the character of the owners' aesthetic, such as contemporary or modern and minimalist, or traditional. And a lot of times, what you get is people who say, well, traditional, I can't use an LED; only the modern ones do. And that's absolutely not true. There's a lot of things that we can work with them to help achieve that desired aesthetic. And of course, mood has a lot to do with how people feel. You want to feel good when you go home. You want to feel relaxed in certain rooms. Maybe you want to feel energetic when you're sitting in your exercise room. So those are things that we try and make sure that we're listening to, talking about, in terms of how we're going to approach the LED option.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />To make sure that we get through today, I didn't list into everything. So I started to look and say, OK, well, what are really good applications that I often use LEDs for in a residence? Under-cabinet lighting or in-cabinet lighting is a wonderful way of introducing LED. There are so many sources today that are nice and small, and there's a lot of great optics to give it a frosted optic. So we no longer see the individual dots, which is not usually desirable. We usually want to see something that's very soft and uniform across the entire surface. Particularly if you're doing an under-cabinet light in a kitchen where you've got tile, which is specular, it's nicer to have something that doesn't give you all of those little pinpoints of light. Some people are probably sitting out there going, I never put LED cabinet lighting in my house. One of the reasons we often do put cabinet lighting in our house is to get vertical surfaces lit. It's amazing: What we're looking at in a house is the vertical surfaces. We often think of lighting only at task surface -- a desk, the kitchen island. But the thing that makes a space feel bright is when we have light on the vertical surfaces: on the finishes, on the books, on the artwork. And so this is an excellent way of getting that visual brightness, which then allows us to use less downlighting and therefore saving energy by putting the energy on a vertical rather than in a task-type situation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another good application for LEDs includes things like cove lights and uplighting. When we light up a ceiling, we can make a space feel much brighter than if we're just downlighting the furniture. As I said before about vertical, the same holds true when we uplight a ceiling. It can make the space feel brighter without introducing more energy. Sometimes it seems like a luxury and only in high-end homes are we going to do this, but that's actually kind of a misnomer. A lot of times, what we'll do is we'll look at doing a wallslot along a wall, which again gives us a lot of vertical illumination. And as you can see in this, we have no downlight in that ceiling. We're only going by a wallslot, which is actually giving us less energy in that hallway than a traditional downlighting method.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Other great applications for LEDs include things like step lighting and task lighting, where we're putting the light where we need it when we need it, instead of again, just a general illumination approach. The nice thing about LEDs is these are much smaller sources now. We can have these tiny little step lights, and we can have less obtrusive task lighting, whether it's for our couch or our table or our desk.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So there are some applications that I still think twice about, at least for now, in introducing LED. And that's actually in some of the general lighting or in the downlighting effects. And the reason why is not because I don't want to think about, hey, could I have all of my entire house LED and energy efficient? But it's because I think about the use of that room. So we think about a dining room. Most of us don't eat in our dining room every day. We're either grabbing a bite at our kitchen island, or sitting at our kitchen table, or even if it's beautiful out, we're sitting out on the porch or barbecuing outside. Our dining room is often reserved for those moments when it's a special occasion. And we all want to look good. And we want our food to look good. And so, since we don't use it very often, there's nothing wrong with saying, hmm, I might leave this in an incandescent so I can get that really warm din, which, while LEDs are allowing us to start with warm din, if you've ever seen it, it's not exactly the same quality. So we look for things like quality. Another good example of when we may not use LED is when we're trying to highlight or pinpoint something like a sculpture or, in this case, a plant, a centerpiece. Some of the LEDs just don't get tight enough. The tightest LED now that we've really seen that's usable is something about a 10-degree. To do a focal point like this, we may use something like a 4-degree beam spread, particularly if it's a higher ceiling. So these are just some of the reasons where I start to evaluate the usefulness over the aesthetics or the use of the room associated with LEDs. One of the things we have to remember about energy is it's also times time. So if I'm not using it in a dining room as much, I say you rethink it.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another time that I really think hard about using LEDs is in decorative lighting. There's a certain quality that we kind of associate with certain kinds of decoratives like candelabras. And we are getting closer and closer and closer with a lot of the LED options out there, but there are still times when you sit there and go, gosh, I just wish it was incandescent, my old favorite. I had a friend and actually a client who said to me, Brooke, do I really have to, if I want to be energy-conscious, put LEDs in my bedside table? And I said, well, no, we don't have to. We can use your standard three-way that you like a lot. Oh, I would just feel so much better, because I could just use that when I read at night. And I just like that option better. So for her room, what we did is we kept the table lamps as incandescent, and we took the tract lighting to an LED retrofit lamp to highlight the photography in her bedroom. Here's another example of when we really thought about it, and we said, huh, in this case, we could do this with LEDs. Some people don't feel that the LEDs give that really, really warm light, like an oil lamp. This was a historic restoration project. And it has a chandelier that had been originally oil. So we looked at using LEDs in a way where we could replicate that feel of oil. So we used a really warm, amber LED to achieve that look with an LED A-lamp type that gave out light in a more general sense. So we had sort of a two-level lighting approach.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I'm going to jump from there into talking about color, partially because we left off with that amber, and I think that this is really important.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />When we think about color in an LED, we remember that when it first started to come out, it wasn't so good. And we are getting much, much better in our color consistency. But we still see an issue. This is an example of a series of LED replacement lamps and some integral modules. We've done the same thing with integral modules. And we looked at them and photographed each of beams. All of these are advertised at 3,000 K color temperature. And as you can see from this, they all look very, very different. Some of them do definitely have a sort of a pinkish quality to them, or some might have even a bluer quality, or a greener, or a yellow. And so each one has sort of a different feeling to the color, a different -- even though it's the same CCT, they have a very different visual appearance.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />We do see that the metrics are getting tighter for evaluating LEDs. And there's numerous metrics out there. And some of them get really complicated. You're looking at CCT with a sort of MacAdam Ellipse step of not greater than three MacAdam Ellipses, or you might see a CRI padding. The R9, which talks about the red, how it renders red colors. There's also a CQS, which started off as a theatrical, or the gamut-area index. And all of these different people are coming out with, well, this is the best way to evaluate LEDs. The bottom line is, manufacturers can choose which metric they want to use. And in some cases, the standard seemed to be lagging, so that we're all knowing we're looking at the same thing. We know we'll get there. We're getting better and better every day.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />But let's take a step back and talk about CCT. It's correlated color temperature. It relates, what does that source look like compared to this piece of metal that we put into a black body radiator? We heat it up, and to look at when it's heated to a certain temperature, what does it look like? And that's how we evaluate the lamp. But there's another way that we need to think about how LEDs and other technologies work. It's called spectral power distribution. We all have seen the rainbow. We all know that all the colors of the rainbow make up white light. And we can make the same color temperature with very different levels of different parts of those wavelengths. So if you see these two drawings here -- or, charts here -- what you see is two different sources with the same correlated color temperature. But I can tell you what you're going to see visually is very different. One is going to render things in the blue region maybe a little bit better. You may see a little bit more of a blue undertone in all the colors that you're looking at, versus this one, that's more in the amber range, similar to the one that I was showing you. If you really had a spectral power distribution of that oil lamp, you would see almost all of it up in this region. The thing to think about with LEDs is that they are a limited wavelength source. They have a very narrow wavelength in which we have been trying to make it, spill it out more and more. And again, we are getting better and better at this. But it doesn't mean that one looks exactly like the other. So you need to know, and ask questions of the manufacturers if you've got something specific.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />What we often tell our clients is there's nothing better than a visual inspection. A mockup. For instance, in this home, the under-cabinet tile has a pinky and an orange color to it. So we did a mockup with them, with Tungsten halogen. And what you see here is you see the pinks and the oranges and the yellows kind of coming out.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And when we did that with LED, with 2,700 K, you kind of lost the pink, but you picked up yellows. Yellows are a little bit more vibrant.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And when we did it with 3,000 K, what we got was mostly pink, and we kind of lost some of the yellow. So there's nothing more important than actually seeing the product you're going to specify. And if you can, like if you're working with the owners directly, do the mockup with the finishes that are going to be in there, with the tiles and the flooring that you're going to choose.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright. Enough about color for now. I'm sure David's going to talk a little bit more about it later. So let's talk about photometrics and how do we evaluate the photometrics. You know, the ENERGY STAR label is good at putting a lot of the information on there.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />One of the things they talk about is the output, or the lumen. Lumens refers to the quantity of light in all directions. So if we think of our old friend the A-lamp, we see what's called the cosign distribution, light in all directions. And this is exactly how LED manufacturers kind of measure the efficacy of their LEDs, in lumens. But, one of the things to think about is that an LED doesn't always have a perfect distribution. We've got the substrate on the back, and a lot of them are actually about 180- or maybe even 120-degree output not all directions.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So one of the other measurements or metrics that is really critical for us to look at is what's called center beam candle power. And this is especially true when you're looking at a recessed downlight that would either have an MR-16 replacement lamp -- and so you're trying to evaluate the replacement lamp -- or an integral module where there is a reflector, which helps push the light out and increase the efficiency of that lamp. Well, then what you start to look at is not the lumens. The lumens are not as important as what's called the center beam candle power, which is measured in candellas. So we looked with down here. And we also have -- it falls off at the angle, which is called the field. And I'm going to give you a picture here.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So this portion right in the center -- let me get my cursor up there for you -- this part right in the center is the center beam. This is the center beam. And this is what's called the center beam area. And note we have the area outside it, which is the fill, or the field. And that light can be as important as the center beam, depending on what you're trying to do. LEDs also have a fair amount of spill that come outside, even the field angle, although some are pretty good at controlling the amount of spill nowadays.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So LEDs produce light differently. When we look at something like a halogen, we have a little small tiny filament that's in there, that's reflecting off of the faceted reflector. And it's pushed to a single point to optimize its beam angle, whether it's a 24-degree beam angle, a flood like a 40-degree beam angle, or whether it's a spot, which gets then in some cases to like a 4-degree beam angle. And then what we have in some cases, so there you can see what we have is the beam angle and the field. But an LED produces -- is a LED chip surface. Sometimes those chips are as if it is a single LED with a phosphor over it. And sometimes it's actually a multi-array LED, which will give you multiple shadows. And so it's not optimized necessarily for the reflector that it's in. The reflectors are getting better and better, to looking at it. But no matter what you do, it's a wider surface than the halogen filament. So sometimes you get things like additional spill that we've controlled a little bit better, at this point in time, with a halogen. I'm not saying that it won't change, because we see changes in LEDs constantly.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So looking at a similar study that we did: This is actually looking at various integral modules. We can see that not all the beams look the same. Even though every one of these is advertised as a flood, that flood could be a 35-degree. It could be a 40-degree. But what we see here is they don't look the same at all. This one has a bright spot in the middle. This one has a real soft beam angle with the field as a little bit more uniform to the center beam. This -- the bottom center. Here what we see is a larger center beam with a little bit of spill. And this one, we see almost all softness with a lot of spill happening. So honestly, the only way we know any of this is by evaluating it. So you have to look at what you're offering to your clients or what you're building into your home.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And some people are like, well, does it really make a difference? Is my client going to be able to see it? So I'm giving you an example. Here it happens to be an outdoor dining space. But you can see the bright spot on the table. You can also look at the very center of the picture is a sculpture. This is lit with incandescent light, and then in 2013, we went back and we retrofitted it and changed it to LED.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And the difference is in my opinion fairly dramatic. The table is so much more soft. We don't have the punch on the table. We don't have the same punch down at the stairs. It's still well-illuminated. But the interesting part is to look at the sculpture here. See how now we can see his legs? If I go back to this, he was dark. His legs were dark, and then lighting design had been focused on his arm and his face and the bird that was on his arm. And now if we go back to the LED, you can see that all of that's a little bit more uniform, a little less spotty on his face, a little bit less highlighted, and we start to see more of the still life. Neither good nor bad, just different. And we need to be aware of those things as we specify our LEDs.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, I'm going to jump into sort of the last topic here, which is controls. If we've seen a big change in technologies with the addition of LEDs, we probably are going to continue to see an even bigger transition in the way we build them, with controls. And part of that is, controls are difficult with LEDs.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />I'm showing here two -- they showed fine when we did our dry run, and for some reason they're turning sideways, so you'll have to bear with us. What I'm showing you is, on the left is a halogen lamp, and on the right is an LED. This is an in-grade fixture in the snow. And the reason why I'm showing this is if you look at the halogen, you see a fairly uniform amount of light. They look like lines of snow or lines of light. But if you look over on the right-hand side, what you see here is as if the lines are pixelated. They look like it's spitting out little dots. That's inherent to an LED. An LED is an electronic technology. It's not where we have a filament that burns. It's not where we have a cathode that's lit up and the lamp is phosphoring. We have an electronic -- it's being turned on and off, on and off, on and off, on and off, at a rate that we don't perceive. This picture that I'm showing you now on the right-hand side of the screen is 2-by-4 troffers in a ceiling. Happens to not be a residential; it's a commercial space. But I grabbed it because I took this photograph when the fixtures were dimmed about 50 percent. And just using a standard iPhone, this is what the photograph looked like. It captured the fact that what's happening is the lights are being turned on and off, on and off, on and off, on and off. And this is critical in some installations. So if you heard my bio, it said that I do a lot videoconferencing. It means that I try not to use LEDs right now at this point with videoconferencing spaces, maybe a home audio or a home theater system, in a situation where I may want to dim it, because of this on-off cycle that can actually reveal itself in a camera world. In other words, we live in a digital world now; our cameras are digital, and our lighting is digital.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />That means that we also have to think about, those things are exacerbated, those things that I just showed previously, that on-off cycle, are exacerbated when we don't have our compatibility of our systems. In other words, if our lamps, which could be reverse phase or forward phase, do not match our driver, and our driver does not match our controls, this option. When we think about the fact that we're going to dim something, we need to make sure that we think about the driver. Is it an electronic low-voltage forward phase, or is it an electronic low-voltage reverse phase? Or one of the most common now is 0 to 10 volts. If the driver that we're proposing, and that's what the manufacturer uses as their standard, then you need to make sure your controls are that way. I've been to many projects where the control station gets installed at a 120-volt spider. Yet, we're putting in a 0 to 10 volt LED lighting. In fact, one of the projects, the electrical contractor blew three power supplies before he came back to me and said, I don't know what's going on -- there's something wrong with the LEDs. And when we talked through it, what we realized is, no, it's not the LEDs. It's the fact that the dimmer was a 120-volt dimmer, and it needed to be the 0 to 10 volt option. So when you have a conversation about controls, you have to have the conversation with the controls and the lamps and the driver all in one thought process, with everybody communicating across all disciplines to make sure that it works.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />If it doesn't, you'll see a lot of artifacts. And so this video here is an example of -- supposedly, this was, the lamps that we put in here were dimming. But we can see one of them does not dim. The other thing that you can see from the design, you're going to see what's called a leak between the control and the compatibility (inaudible). And if you go back and (inaudible) between all the ingredients that go into your spaghetti, and we put it all together, we have a wonderful meal.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And this is the same, this can be true of LEDs, provided you have that mocked through the thought processes, you know, used fixtures that you're confident with and manufacturers that you know. Talk to people in the industry. Research what you're going to specify. Visually evaluate the product that you are going to specify. And then make sure that you test it with your dimming system. Ask a lot of questions. So I guess that's a good place -- Jamie, if the audience has any questions?</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Absolutely. Thanks, Brooke. We've gotten a number of good questions, and I'll recap a few here. So Brooke, chronologically, going back to one of your earlier slides -- I think it was the case study that you were showing for a New York residence. Your estimated time of lighting used per day was eight hours, and then one of our attendees asked, is that typical? Because some studies show a lower lighting use per day, more like two hours. So is that something regarding that residence, or how did you arrive at the eight-hour estimate per day, for the lighting use?</p>
<p><em>Brooke Silber:</em><br />For this particular analysis, I started off with it happens to be somebody that works from home. So therefore they use more of the spaces more frequently. They have a home office, and they're often in the kitchen more frequently. So for the purposes of this study, we used that timeframe, again, because it was this home office and certain areas were used more. Yes, I would agree that most homes are not used that frequently. If you average out the various rooms in the day: You've got your bedroom; you may use the lighting for an hour or two when you wake up in the morning, and an hour or two when you go to bed. You're sitting there reading or maybe watching television, and you've got one of the lamps on. Whereas the kitchen may get as much as six hours a day because you're in there one or two hours in the morning getting breakfast. If you stop back for lunch -- which many people don't -- but you hear another hour there. But your dinner time tends to be -- and your congregation, while you're getting dinner, that tends to be people -- in many homes, in many clients that we've had, tend to congregate -- and so therefore you may end up with four hours in the evening of time in there. So yes, this is a little bit of a -- this particular client. And I would say that more likely I would use something like a four-hour daytime as a recommendation, if you are running an analysis.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. And that sort of branches into a next sort of grouping of questions. I'll just kind of throw it at you like your spaghetti -- see what you can make of it. There's a few questions regarding incandescents. Are they available in Zero Energy Ready Homes? And they are. Incandescents can be used to an extent. The metric for a high-efficiency lighting was 80 percent. And just a side note: Energy code 2012 calls for 75 percent of the lighting to be high-efficacy. So the Zero Ready program is just a step, really, ahead of codes that are coming into play in many states. But for you, Brooke: Any thoughts on whether -- you seem to prefer some non-LED solutions in certain cases depending on what's being lit. But if that's an incandescent solution, are there concerns that the solution won't be available within a few more years? And then, sort of related to what you were just saying on that case study, have you balanced out the expected performance you can get out of LEDs with areas that use a lot of light on a daily basis, and the energy savings LEDs could provide? That sort of a balancing act where you're looking at energy savings versus the expected performance of the LED.</p>
<p><em>Brooke Silber:</em><br />Alright. So let me try and break this out. I'll try and take the first one first. This really is where when wemake a choice of LED versus incandescent, I don't see that it's an all-or-nothing thing. You do not have to have your entire house in zero energy to qualify for the ENERGY STAR. As you mentioned, about 50 percent of the lamps, or 75 percents of the lamps -- I guess it said 80, excuse me, 80 percent of the lamps should be energy-efficient lamps. So I really choose to look very carefully at what we're trying to craft. Again, if it's the dining room and we want some beautiful sconces on the wall, and the way that the sockets of the LEDs work provide a shadow that is not pleasing, I may go with an incandescent candelabra for night now. And yet, as of right now, there's many of them that are still on the market. Especially if I'm using something like a historic restoration lamp, a lot of those are still going to be available because they're considered a specialty lamp. Or rough service lamps are a great one to use because they also extend your hours. The life of your lamp. Instead of using something that's going to be 1,000 hours, the rough services are often about 3,000 hours, and if I dim that I can get it up to 6,000 or even more hours. So the maintenance becomes less of an issue. So then what I do is I really look at saying, as I said, by application. What is really good for LEDs, and what spaces are really good? So often my offices are one that I may be using an LED, whereas my dining room is I don't. My laundry rooms and play rooms are great uses of LEDs. And sometimes my kitchen may be a very good place to use for LED. That one I really try and let the owner help with. Some people are sensitive to LEDs. I had another lighting designer who pointed out in his office when they look at flicker, they use all the women in their offices. Because apparently they see flicker better than the men do. Who knew. And so some women can be very sensitive to the flicker that LEDs can cause. And so if they're spending a lot of time in their kitchen, I try to make sure that they're not sensitive to it, because then we could use another choice. I had a friend of mine -- it wasn't a client; it was a friend of mine -- who asked me some questions about his kitchen. And he had a fixture that had a three-lamp, a three-socket, close to ceiling. And in that particular case, he kept telling me how he liked to have the lights turn on quickly and he liked the full spectrum of the incandescent. But he wanted to be green and he wanted to use energy efficiency. So high-tech, can I put two of those as LEDs and one of those as incandescent. So we got the energy savings and he could feel good about being green, but he still had that sort of "on" responsiveness and sort of the fill in the color spectrum that he was desiring for while he cooked. So I really choose it very carefully. So the second part of your question is, how do I look at that with the energy payback? I gave a very simple one here, and I have done more complex ones. But literally, you can work it through with each room. What are the ones that tend to be left on? My family: The basement, where my five-year-old son goes downstairs, tends to be left on until Mommy goes down to do laundry and turns it off. That's a perfect candidate for looking at how do I reduce the energy and by using LEDs associated with the time. I'm hoping that answers the participant's question.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Yea, that makes sense. So we're going to move ahead to David Brignati's piece of the presentation now, so if you want to make him the presenter, Brooke, that would be good. And I'll introduce David quickly while you do that. Just to remind everybody, we're going to try to stay right on our timeframe to wrap this up by 1:15 Eastern.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />But on to David. David Brignati has 20 years of experience in the field of architecture, and he's been familiar in both commercial and residential design. And he brings a unique perspective to Newport Ventures' work in energy efficiency research, training, and integration. In his residential work, David was the team lead on the New York capital region's very first home to achieve LEED Gold certification. David's also trained hundreds of code officials, builders, architects, on issues related to building energy codes and building science. And regarding lighting, David's been coordinating the integration of LED lighting packages in a series of pilot homes in New York over the last year or so, and that's sort of the program he'll be focusing on today. David's a registered architect in New York and New Hampshire, a LEED AP as well as an AIA member who's active on the Committee on the Environment. Take it away, David.</p>
<p><em>David Brignati:</em><br />OK, thanks, Jamie. Hopefully you can hear me.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Yes.</p>
<p><em>David Brignati:</em><br />OK.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Well, basically what Brooke had discussed, we were given a project or had gotten a project with NYSERDA, New York State's Energy Research and Development Authority, to essentially create five 100-percent LED-lit homes. These five homes are located across New York State, two of them in the Rochester area, two of them here in the capital region where I am currently located, and then one down in the Hudson Valley in New Paltz. And what we did was the product included the use of the design and everything that Brooke had just mentioned, as well as being provided some incremental costs to upgrade the lighting from the standard lighting package of a builder to 100-percent LED lighting. It also includes monitoring that we're going to be doing for approximately nine months for heating and cooling season, or summer / winter and then a shoulder season. And then also to get some consumer reactions as to how they like the lighting in their homes, as well as other outreach that we did at the beginning of this project.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So, one of the outreach, the earlier outreach that we did, was what is the preferred source of lighting? What you see here in the upper left corner of the screen is a lightbox that we had created and put in various colored objects -- call them a still life -- where we asked people to determine which light they preferred within that box. And the light sources were hidden so they didn't know what type of light they were looking at. And within the box, we had an LED bulb, an incandescent bulb, and a CFL bulb, a compact fluorescent. And what we found was almost two-thirds of the people -- 60 percent, 59 percent -- had chosen the LED light. Most people or a number of people still enjoy the incandescent light. And not too many people at all really had chosen the compact fluorescents.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Some of the words that we heard, some of the quotes that we heard from people as we were talking to them, is basically that not too many people like the CFLs that are out there. When we asked them which box they preferred when they looked at it, why did they go to that box, what was the lighting for, what was better about it, and a lot of people said that the LED box seemed brighter, or the LED box seemed clearer. And then a number of people actually said they liked the colors within the still life that were being represented there. And of course, there were a few people that were like, LE-whats? And they really didn't understand what LED lighting was all about yet. They hadn't gotten brought up to speed, but we did inform them as to what the LEDs were and how energy efficient they were.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what we did for the project was, with each client, with each homeowner, Jan and Brooke took some time, met with the client when there was a client, to understand how they were going to use the home, how they were going to use the space, and created a lighting design based on that. To simplify it a little bit, we really looked at the use of space, the traffic patterns, the furniture. You know, as Brooke had mentioned, those personal questions were asked. You know, how do you guys use your bedroom? Where do you shave your legs? Those questions were asked of the homeowners. What type of light did they really want to have? Was it general? Task? Accent? And then as well, the amount of light. The lumen output. As Brooke had mentioned, how much brightness or how much light do you need in this space? And then, a lot of it came down to color temperature, as well. Did they want the space to be a warm space? Did they want the space to be utilitarian type of kitchen use, or laundry -- is that going to be the 3,000, 3,500 Kelvin? That kind of thing for color temperature. And then cost. The cost was really one of the main drivers. The designs that came out -- Brooke had mentioned a number of times that uplighting and where LEDs really can shine with the incremental costs that we were allowed. Trying to manage what we could and couldn't put in the homes was really based on cost.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And what we did find is that the cost was a strong driving factor, as well. So when we did talk with the homeowners, we spoke to them about the benefits of LEDs and what they can and can't do.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And basically, the graphic here that you see is four types of bulbs: traditional incandescent, halogen incandescent, CFLs, and LEDs. And what you see is most of them are in the same brightness range, around 800 lumens. And the biggest thing is that traditional bulbs create a lot of wasted energy. The red designation up here at the top of the bulbs. And when you see an LED light, you see that the majority of what's coming out is actually visible light versus heat. And what that does is also give the light, or give the lightbulb, shall I say, a little bit more longevity. If you take a look at the hearts, that's about the lifespan or the life expectancy of the bulb. You know, an incandescent really has one heart representing about 1,000 hours, versus an LED that has 25 hearts and can go up to 25,000. We've seen bulbs up at 50,000. So initial cost is something to think about, as well. With respect to an incandescent bulb, they're about 50 cents a bulb. And with LEDs, you see that it's around $6.28. And even since I've made this slide just recently, those costs have come down. We've seen bulbs that can get down into the $5, $4 range. But something you need to be wary of is what you're buying.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So when you're looking at what you're buying, there's a thing that's been created by the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC, a Lighting Facts label. It's not so much that you go out and buy a 60-watt bulb now. What you do is you go out and you buy a 60-watt equivalent. But you know, as Brooke mentioned, what does that mean? What is that 60-watt equivalent? And even within the lighting facts that we've learned, you know, 870 lumens, energy use 13 watts, and the light appearance of 2,700 K, you know, you're still not getting an apples-for-apples comparison there. So it's really difficult, and the best thing to do is, like Brooke said, is get light and turn it on, and put it on the surface that you want to see. But with the Lighting Facts labels -- you see an ENERGY STAR label here with the FTC label -- what that does is at least put the guarantee on there that these bulbs have a three-year minimum warranty. And then the Lighting Facts that are in this FTC label -- some of these items may actually not have standardized testing that they have to adhere to, as opposed to the DOE Lighting Facts label. This is a voluntary labeling system where DOE actually has vetted and put into place standards or testing that are required for each one of these items that are in there, such as the lumen output, the efficacy, or the color accuracy. So while this is a voluntary system, it's actually very stringent with respect to the amount of testing that needs to go on in order to be vetted and to be put onto that Lighting Facts label. Whereas the Lighting Facts from the FTC, there are some things on there that may actually not be vetted by a standard testing procedure.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then as we were talking with the homeowners and the builders, understanding what they wanted in the home, the lumens, the amount of brightness, and the efficacy that's available with these bulbs, again, as you see, it says, think lumens, not watts. You know, you're not buying a 60-watt bulb or you're not buying a 60-watt fixture. You're really looking for 800 lumens. And what we're really looking for is the efficacy, or lumens per watt. So a 60-watt incandescent, you're really only getting 13 units of light out of that 60 watts. So a lot of that energy is being wasted as heat, as opposed to the LED bulb, where we're getting about 80 lumens per watt. So that will be a much greater, much more energy-efficient bulb. And a better product to choose.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And again, we mentioned the color range / color temperature. In speaking with the homeowners and understanding what they want, we came up with solutions where we put the warmer colors -- you know, the 2,700 to 3,000, maybe 3,500 Kelvin -- we put those in the areas where Brooke had mentioned, say, the dining room, or the living room, maybe even the master bedroom sometimes. And then the cooler colors a lot of times go in the kitchen and the more utility areas. We put them in there. So that's what we spoke to homeowners a lot about.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And also what we mentioned to them in providing an understanding of what LEDs do or can and can't do, is we also mentioned the color rending index. With that lightbox project, or lightbox outreach that we had in the beginning, I did mention that we had those still lifes in there with various colored objects in there. What people actually saw was, the light on the same objects actually looked like different colors. So with the color rendering index, you know, an incandescent bulb is about 95-plus color rendering index, meaning that it renders colors to what we would normally consider to be correct. So as you see the apple here, with a 2,700 Kelvin light source and a color rendering index of 97, that apple looks the true red that we expect it to look. But as we move down, and each light source is still 2,700 Kelvin, but we lose the color rendering index. In other words, there's a color shift going on, based on what that light source is providing. We end up down with a CRI of 70 or 80, where that red apple is actually going into the maroonish range, or even a pinkish range. So the color rendering index was very important to people to understand, so that their furniture and things like that that they purchased would look correct when they were in them.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then availability. What was out there with respect to the project. When we first started the project, you know, for just a basic LED replacement bulb, what you would buy is "a 60-watt equivalent." We were seeing bulbs in the range of $25 to sometimes $50. But with that cost, you're also getting a bulb that, you know, supposedly has longer longevity of anywhere from 22.8 years up to 30 years. But what we've found, we've had the project now for probably 16 months, and these bulb prices have been coming down dramatically, as well as the integral LED fixtures. Brooke had mentioned where, rather than putting a standard fixture in there with a bulb, there are some fixtures that are made that are just integral LEDs, where there really is no bulb. It's just the light source and a computer chip that glows.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And what we've seen sometimes when that happens is you get what you pay for. When you see the light source here on the left, this is actually an LED bulb, and what we're getting from this bulb is the shine and spread and distribution that we would be expecting from this type of light source, whereas here on the right side, we have a halogen lamp that we're actually getting a lot of striations and not the output that we're looking for. So depending on what you're looking for and how much money you're willing to spend, you may get varying qualities with respect to those lights.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And something we did find we needed to be very wary of is low-quality LEDs. We needed to watch to make sure that the LEDs that we were getting were following minimum standards, and making sure that the light that we had chosen did have the color quality and the brightness that we wanted. Also, there's the possibility of failing to meet the life expectancy. You know, LED bulbs have not been around for 35 years. So knowing what that life expectancy is, what we really need to understand, is that the warranties right now are really three years, five years, sometimes seven years, but the life expectancy of the bulb is 30 years. So these are things that needed to be taken into account when specifying and buying these.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Also, what we did find as we were doing our research, trying to get the best quality light for the right amount of cost and budgetary concerns, that a lot of times there were unreliable LED drivers out there. Again, certain manufacturers followed some standards; other manufacturers have not. So making sure that we found the right drivers. And then also, variations in the LED chips. Again, Brooke had mentioned, and you saw those displays of a 3,000-degree light really could have a lot of different light qualities to it. So you needed to buy that light and make sure it worked. And then the inconsistent or incompatible dimming, as Brooke had mentioned. You really have to think about the controls with respect to LEDs when you're putting them into a home.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And really, the life expectancy and the warranty. Here the biggest thing is really to probably just look through under the ENERGY STAR label on the bulbs or the fixtures that you're buying. At least they're showing a minimum standard for what's going out there, or what you're purchasing, and providing the warranty or at least some warranty that you're looking for, even though those bulbs are expected to last, or those fixtures are expected to last for quite a number of years.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then something else we learned as we were doing the project is something called infant mortality. I know it's not a very nice term, but it's one used in the industry by manufacturers. We had gone to a number of seminars with respect to them. You know, here's a light that we spec'd in one of the homes, and this is an integral LED, so there's actually no bulbs in this fixture. And there's one light source missing. And we called the manufacturer, asked them what was going on. And what we were able to do is actually work on the wiring within the fixture that we had. And we got that one to work. But there are a number of fixtures that could be, based on the fact of the newness or the -- I guess the newer bulbs and the newer fixtures, there could be some issues with a number of them failing, just because of the fact that they're so new.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then as Brooke mentioned, lighting controls is very important. Within our project, Lutron gave us a system, the Lutron Caseta Wireless System, to put in each home. And what that does is give you the ability to control the lights within your home with a Smart Bridge Pro box that connects to the router within the home, and then therefore talks to the switches that are put into the home, and also can talk to an iPhone or Android app, and therefore you'd be able to control the lights from pretty much anywhere in the world that you have an Internet connection. And what we did see a lot of times when we put bulbs in, or when we put fixtures in, that its dimming capabilities of the very, very well-received by the homeowners. And then, just a quick mention: Energy codes and above-code programs.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The high-efficacy bulbs -- the LED lighting, the LED fixtures -- mentioned throughout the ENERGY STAR program, above-code programs, Zero Energy Ready program, and energy codes. So the LEDs are a really good, easy way to get those efficiencies that are required there.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then within the project, you know, had we noticed that there's anything with the trades, that we needed to do anything differently with them, and really there wasn't much that had to change.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />What we did notice is that the lighting itself, depending on what type of lighting was chosen, whether it was integral LED or replacement bulbs, we did have, say, here in a house with air barrier compliance, what you see there in the recessed cans, those are actually not recessed cans. Those are streamlined LEDs, where they are essentially not punching a hole in the air barrier. They're able to be air-sealed very well, and it creates a much better air barrier with respect to that. So that was a sidebar to the LEDs, that we found was another advantage to them.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then, one of the homes in our project, this home in New Paltz, this is actually a zero energy home that we expect the savings to be somewhere between 66 to 75 percent of standard code-minimum homes. So what we did was have 100 percent LEDs put into the home, and we estimated that there would be about $7.03 in monthly costs to run those LEDs, as opposed to code-minimum homes where you have a certain percentage of lighting that's high-efficiency and a certain percentage that's not required. And we ran the math and numbers on those, and it's estimated that those would be around $28 or $29 or $21 or run. And you see that over a year's savings you end up with quite a bit of savings with respect to those. So this, you know, four-level finished home is really running at very low costs with respect to the lighting within that house.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So with the project, we feel it's so far been very successful, and we're looking forward to the monitoring capabilities later on and the report coming out at the end of the presentation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Or excuse me, at the end of that project. And then just quick, you know, takeaways for what we learned on the project. We learned that LEDs are incredibly energy efficient. Make sure you purchase high-quality LEDs, ensure that the controls are compatible, and make sure you understand the use and task that's being lit and specify the lighting accordingly. And with that, I'll pass it back to Jamie ...</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Thank-you, David.</p>
<p><em>David Brignati:</em><br />... and see if there's any questions with respect to that.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />We have time for just a couple questions.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />I'm going to group a few together. They're really good insights. We've been pretty silent about CFLs. And so a number of the questions get into that issue, and I guess I can summarize them by stating ... -- Do you have the last slide, to show it on your screen?</p>
<p><em>David Brignati:</em><br />Actually, I do.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Take your time. So, this question gets to the relative efficiency of LEDs versus CFLs, and isn't there an overlap? So if Brooke or David wants to speak to that. And sort of another chapter in that comparison: What about any environmental concerns regarding the use of LEDs or CFLs?</p>
<p><em>David Brignati:</em><br />Well, I'll talk to the environmental concerns of LEDs or CFLs. CFLs do contain mercury. They are something that needs to be disposed of properly. I know a lot of the big-box stores actually have recycling programs for those. But with respect to LEDs, they're essentially computer chips, or if they're an LED bulb, it's really still computer-generated light, or digital light. So there really isn't much as far as environmental concerns with respect to those. Personally, I would still dispose of them in the same way that I would dispose of other electronics, such as TVs and things like that. I'd give them back to a recycling program so they could mine out what actually went into those fixtures or bulbs.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />In terms of the efficiency, it is true. CFLs and LEDs do have some overlap in the range of lumens per watt that different products might achieve. The ENERGY STAR criteria for LEDs, for example, laid the bar at 55 lumens per watt for several types of LED bulbs over 10 watts in their capacity. So I guess I would circle back to some of our earlier comments. LEDs certainly can go far above that 55 lumens per watt level, but I also believe it's a balancing act between chasing that efficacy and also ensuring the performance, in terms of all the metrics, like an accurate color temperature rating. The ENERGY STAR spec for LEDs has requirements for maintaining lumens over time. And a number of things like that, like a minimum CRI of at least 80. So it's sort of like the Zero Energy Ready Home; overall we want high efficiency, but we also want good assured performance levels of all technologies in the home.</p>
<p><em>Brooke Silber:</em><br />Jamie, I would make the comment that one of the things that we definitely see is that LEDs are very quickly replacing the market of compact fluorescents. And part of that is in the performances. So if you look at the efficacy, I mean, that's only one metric. And it is probably, you know, if you compare some compact fluorescents, which are about, as you said, 55 lumens per watt, compared with a lot of LEDs, which are often 80 lumens per watt or above, you're just over half -- you know, about 60 percent -- of that efficacy. But there are some other things you want to think about in efficacy. There's a lot -- I mean, compact fluorescents can be difficult to dim, just as LEDs. They take a certain amount of components. And many compact fluorescents themselves don't give you the ability to do a lot of 100 to 0 percent, or even to 5 percent. They're kind of hovering somewhere around 18 percent, which is similar to what many LEDs are. And that's sort of screw-based. The only way you get a lot of the really good efficiency with compact fluorescents is if you're going with a quad-pit compact fluorescent. And actually, we've seen better color out of LEDs than compact fluorescents. Especially in the dimming. When you dim a compact fluorescent, you tend to get something that almost makes it looks grayish. Where it meets, in the LEDs when you're dimming it, what you see is the consistency of the color. The color doesn't tend to shift or morph too much, unless of course you buy it with the intent of having a color-shifting LED, or what's often referred to as a warm din. So honestly, some of the comparisons with the use of LED versus compact fluorescent that are making us make the choice of compact fluorescent just isn't there. It's a source we see phasing out faster than incandescent in a lot of our industry. Linear fluorescents still have a lot of great efficacy. Their lamp lives now are equivalent with a lot of LEDs. So you look at an LED being at 50,000 hours; you can get a linear fluorescent at 46,000 hours, where the compact fluorescent is still down to like 10. So, I mean, from my makeup of specifications, I often specify LEDs, linear fluorescents, and then some incandescents. And I actually don't specify a lot of compact fluorescents for the reasons I just mentioned.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Great. Really good points, Brooke. Thank-you. So we're at our time. The closing slide here notes the website for the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program. We always invite builders, raters, in particular who are interested in becoming partners, to go visit the site. Certainly, everyone else is welcome to, as well. And then we list the three contacts. For the program contact, <a href="mailto:zero@newportpartnersllc.com">zero@newportpartnersllc.com</a>. And then you also see Brooke and David's respective email addresses there. So one last reminder: This has been recorded, so you'll be able to access this online as a recording within a couple weeks. And there's a whole library of similar videos on other topics regarding DOE Zero Energy Ready Home available on that website, so feel free to access those at any point in time. And we look forward to continuing to work with all of our partners. Thank-you, Brooke. Thank-you, David. Thanks to everybody for joining us today. Bye-bye.</p>
