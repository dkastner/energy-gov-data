<p><em>GoToWebinar voice:</em><br />The broadcast is now starting. All attendees are in listen-only mode.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Hi, everyone. We're here to welcome you to the Department of Energy Zero Energy Ready Home Technical Training Webinar Series. We're really excited that you can join us today for our session on energy and water efficiency in the Zero Energy Ready Home program. This is going to be presented today by Jonah Schein with EPA, who works primarily on WaterSense. Today's session is one in a continuing series of technical training webinars that we host to support our partners in designing and building these high-performance homes. My name is Lindsay Parker. I'm the coordination support for the program. I'll be covering some general notes on webinar housekeeping. All attendees will be in listen-only mode throughout the webinar. However, we do invite you to ask questions if you have any pop up, and you can do so through the questions application in the GoToWebinar program. We will be monitoring these questions throughout the webinar, so if any come up, we'll definitely ping Jonah to answer some along the way. Otherwise, we'll cover some questions at the end of the webinar. This session is being recorded, so if you would like to revisit it afterward, we will be putting the webinar recording on our Zero Energy Ready Home resources site. That way you can access it later on. There will also be a PDF of the presentation available afterward, which I will send out through an email to all people who have registered, so you'll have both a PDF of the presentation and the recording of the webinar and a transcript of it. But please allow some time for the recording to be added online. This does take some time for transcribing and adding to the DOE YouTube page. With that, I'm going to hand it over to our technical director, Jamie Lyons of Newport Partners, who is going to talk a little bit about the Zero Energy Ready Home program and will introduce Jonah.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Thank-you, Lindsay, and welcome, everybody. Just a few quick words to offer some context on why we're running this webinar today and its relevance to Zero Energy Ready Homes.</p>
<p><em>First slide:</em><br />Over the last year and a half or so, DOE has had the privilege of working with builders and raters and other industry partners all around the country running half-day training sessions on Zero Energy Ready Homes. The business side of that, the marketing and the messaging side of that, and the technical specs that get you to what DOE calls a Zero Energy Ready Home. So it's a really good session, but with covering all that ground there's not a lot of time to do a deep drill into a topic like this, like efficient hot water distribution in the home and overall water conservation. So that's the purpose of these technical training webinars, to reach out and provide a little more information and dialogue with our partners about a specific topic like this. That's what we're covering today. And when we talk about the topic, we like to give a little context as to, this is an efficiency program, an energy efficiency program -- why are we looking at water and why we're looking at this aspect of water. And in short, if you look at all the different water usage in and around a home, hot water distribution is a pretty big deal. Once the water distribution system goes in a new home, it's more than likely to stay that way for the life of the home, and there's a pretty strong nexus between that hot water distribution system and energy use. Obviously, there's also a really strong implication for water usage. Oftentimes, with less efficient hot water distribution, we lose a lot of hot water, hundreds of thousands of gallons of water annually going down the drain while Mr. and Mrs. Jones sits there waiting for hot water to the tap. So there's definitely an energy issue here, because this is hot water that we can leave existing in that distribution system, which is eventually the energy from that hot water is wasted. We're losing water, so there's a water conservation issue. And then a really strong theme to this program overall is the home's performance, how the home lives, how the home works. And this aspect of hot water distribution is a really good example of DOE looking at home performance because when we get this system right, Mr. and Mrs. Jones now have hot water faster. So we're saving energy, we're saving water, and the home is living and performing much better. So in a nutshell, that's why we are taking a careful look at hot water distribution as part of DOE's Zero Energy Ready Homes, and that's why Jonah is timely serving to educate us on the topic today in a webinar. So as we hand it off to Jonah, just a word about him. Jonah Schein is with U.S. EPA. He's a technical coordinator for new homes and buildings at EPA; he's WaterSense program. He's overseeing the technical development and implementation of WaterSense New Homes specs and their certification systems since the inception. He's also responsible for efforts to expand the WaterSense program and its reach out into the multifamily and commercial sectors. Prior to this role with EPA -- 2008 when Jonah joined EPA -- he had been the director of outreach for the Earth Day Network, where he was responsible for different initiatives to promote water efficiency through green building strategies, in both the U.S. and the Middle East. Mr. Schein, Jonah, holds a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science degree from Indiana University, as well as a master's of science, environmental science, from John Hopkins. Jonah, thanks for joining us today, and we're going to turn it over to you.</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />OK, thanks, Jamie.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />OK, there we go. It's always really great to talk to the Zero Energy Ready Homes community. It's always a treat for me to talk to people in the building science world who are really committed to building, as Jamie said, not just efficient homes, but also really high-performing homes. The kind of homes that we'd all be excited to live in and take and be a part in.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what I wanted to cover today was to give you a little bit of background on what exactly a WaterSense Labeled Home is. After that, I want to take a step back and really talk about why WaterSense is here. I like to do that, because I find that especially in the building science world and the green building world, when you talk to people, there's this general sense that water is a really big issue, and that it's going to be an issue that we have to deal with in the coming years. Not a lot of people can really articulate why that is, though, and I think it's important that we start moving in that direction. As representatives of the building science community, we're able to go out there and explain why water really matters. I'll talk a little bit about the WaterSense requirements as a whole. As Jamie mentioned, I'll spend most of my time really diving in to an efficient hot water distribution system, which is an element of the WaterSense labeled program, which is required in Zero Energy Ready Homes. Most of our -- most of the attributes of the WaterSense Labeled Homes are encouraged but not necessarily required. The hot water distribution actually is required. Finally, I'll touch on the outdoor requirements. And then I want to make sure that everyone knows where to go to find additional resources and materials. So, before I jump into that material, though, one of the things that's really useful for me is to know a little bit about who I'm talking to. So we have a couple of questions queued up. Lindsay, can we go ahead and ask people those poll questions at this point?</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Sure thing, Jonah. So, I'm launching the first poll, which is the question, what best describes your profession? Are you a builder, a rater, a verifier, code official, architect, or other? I'm going to let the poll go for a few seconds before closing it. We appreciate any participation. ...</p>
<p><em>Poll question:</em><br />OK. I'm going to go ahead and close the poll now. I think most of you have responded. So here we have -- let's see, 15 percent of you are builders, 14 are verifiers, 3 percent of you are code officials, 10 percent are architects, 50 percent are other.</p>
<p><em>Poll results:</em><br />And now I'm going to go to the second question that we have, and launch that poll question. How familiar are you with the WaterSense New Homes programs? Are you very familiar, pretty familiar, not very familiar, or you are aware of these products but not in new homes? ... OK, great, thanks. I'm going to close the poll. Most of you have responded. Seven percent are very familiar, but I see the majority are not very familiar, so it's great to have you on the webinar. With 23 percent being pretty familiar and 10 percent being aware but not in homes. So, alright, Jonah, it should be over back to you.</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />OK. Thanks, Lindsay, and thanks, everyone, for answering those questions. Like I said, it's always helpful for me to know a little bit about who I'm talking to and what your level of familiarity is.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I guess I want to start with exactly what is the WaterSense Labeled New Homes. The WaterSense New Homes program is the first national new home label for water effiiciency. We started labeling homes really in 2010. I think we finalized the specification in 2009. But a few years ago, to be honest, certainly the single attribute programs such as ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup> really only focused on things like energy efficiency. Even the multi-attribute programs, things like LEED, or the National Green Building Certification, at that point, to be honest, were a little bit weak on water efficiency. When you consider what an important resource water is and how much of our infrastructure as a nation is dedicated to supplying clean, healthy, safe water, it's a little bit -- well, I don't want to say it's surprising, but it was something that really needed to change. And that's part of what the WaterSense Labeled Homes program is here to do. So, knowing that that was the landscape we were dealing with, we designed the program to work really well and as a relatively easy addition to existing programs such as ENERGY STAR or in this case, like the Zero Energy Ready Homes program. WaterSense Labeled New Homes, our goal is to save at least 20 percent compared to a conventional new home. We also have requirements in there that help educate homeowners. They can continue the water efficiency behaviors. And like all WaterSense labeled products, WaterSense Labeled Homes are third-party certified. So just how much value is in a WaterSense Labeled Home? Well, considering that most of the requirements of WaterSense Labeled Homes are really low-cost, no-cost, relatively easy incremental steps, we think there's a tremendous value there. A family of four living in a WaterSense Labeled Home, compared to a typical new home, is going to save about 50,000 gallons of water a year, and usually more than $600 on their water, sewer, and energy bills. In addition to that, outside, where we do have requirements for landscape design and if installed, irrigation as well, those landscapes are going to be easy to maintain and offer longtime curb appeal. So like I said, it really is a tremendous value.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now why this is important to people in the building industry is -- and you heard Jamie touch on this, as well -- first and foremost, we think the whole house building science approach really does need to include water. Part of what we're doing in a lot of these programs but also in Zero Energy Ready Homes, is, yes, we're building houses that are going to save money and they're going to be efficient, but at the end of the day, they're simply better homes. When we talk about home buyers, I think most of us would agree that 99 times out of 100, the things that people are first and foremost concerned with are price, location, and style. We don't know what No. 4 is going to be. There's a growing segment of the population for whom the environmental aspect is really important. They want to feel good about their homes. There's people who respond just simply to the convenience factor. of knowing that they're going to be comfortable in their home. And there's people that just simply respond to knowing that better is better. That the home is built with conscious attention paid to the attributes that are going to have a long- lasting impact on what it's like to live and use and be in that home long-term. So the great thing about the whole house building science approach is that it really helps us speak to all of those consumers. And certainly I thinnk WaterSense is a great way to continue that from some of the areas that we've already been looking at that, at the whole house building science approach, and add even more convenience, efficiency, and confidence in the home. So that's what a WaterSense Labeled Home is.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Let me take a quick step back and talk about why is WaterSense here, and why does EPA, the agency that I work for, feel that a program like WaterSense was a good way to approach some of the challenges that we faced in the country.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Jonah, real quick? I had a timely question, since you're describing WaterSense homes, what they are. Can existing homes be WaterSense labeled?</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />Existing homes can be WaterSense labeled. The program is designed with new construction in mind. But it can be applied to rehab projects. There are some things that tend to be a little challenging with rehab projects, and we don't adjust the criteria. So, when we get to talking about the hot water distribution later, which very much has to do with how the pipes are laid out inside the home, we don't adjust that for existing homes. So you have to meet the performance requirements, even though it might be a pretty heavy lift to open up the walls and rearrange the plumbing. There are some potential work-arounds for that, but that's one of the things that tends to make existing homes a little bit of a heavier lift when it comes to the WaterSense label. Does that answer the question?</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />That's perfect; thank-you.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Getting back to why WaterSense is here. First of all, we need more water in this country, all the time. The population is still growing. And from a water supply perspective, unfortunately, it's often growing the fastest in places where we can least afford it, from a water supply standpoint. If you look at the numbers on this map to the right, those represent population growth. And the shading represents per capita water usage. So the dark states with big numbers really pose a problem when you consider that we're a country with an aging infrastructure. We haven't invested in it the same way we have in years past. And yet somehow, our population is growing. We hope that our economy will continue to grow. And water is a big part of that. Our public supply water system is really one of the engines to economic growth. And certainly population growth in this country. So we need to figure out a way to continue to meet that need. Unfortunately -- everyone remembers five or six years ago, we had the stimulus, and we had this sudden surge of money that we spent on infrastructure. Well, we took -- we spent about $6 billion back then on water infrastructure projects. Our need over the next 20 years is on the order of $700 billion. So the "surge" in investment that we had and we're not likely to see again was $6 billion. Our needs, about $700 billion. That math doesn't really add up. Additionally, we're expecting water shortages in over 40 states. Now, this report has kind of circulated in the news lately, and a lot of times people miss the point. The take-home point to me of that report is that those are non-drought water shortages. So 40 out of the 50 states, given average supply, average demand, are expecting to not have enough water to meet their needs in the coming years. Now, we're not so lucky as to not have drought. We know we're going to get drought. We're a big enough country. We're varied enough in terms of climate that every year we're going to face drought. So it's just another layer of complexity onto this challenge of continuing to supply clean, healthy, safe drinking water.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what's that done to the cost of water? Let's make no mistake. Water is still really, really cheap in this country right now. It's about $10 for 1,000 gallons water and wastewater combined, is what people found average across the country. But over the last few years, we started to do something really interesting. This is CPI, so that's the consumer price index. Relative to that line, things are getting more expensive when they're above that line, less expensive when they're below it. And let's look at how it compares to some of the utilities. Housing tends to track pretty closely to CPI because most of us spend an awful lot of money on housing. Electricity, even though you might not want to admit it the day you pay your electric bill, but relative to the price of other goods, electricity has really stayed relatively affordable over the last few years. Natural gas, as many of us are aware, is a little more volatile. In the winter of 2012, a lot of us to heat our homes in the northeast or the northern part of the country, really appreciated that dip you see in natural gas, because it saved us a lot of money. I would like to look at gasoline, too. Because that's really sort of the most consistent price signal we get when it comes to energy, right? By the time I pay my electric bill, I've already used that electricity a month ago. There's no real feedback. But I see the price of gas all the time, and I pay the price of gas all the time. So just to sort of underscore what this difference makes, anyone remember paying for gas in 1998? I think the national average that year was under $2. It was like ... $1.03 in 1998. By the time we get to 2012, the average cost of gasoline in the country was $3.62. So this is what one dollar and three cents to $3.62 looks like in terms of CPI. And now this is water. The only thing in the entire CPI catalog that comes close to matching water and sewer -- I hate to tell it, for people that have teenagers and high school kids -- is college tuition. The really scary part about this, is that most people are -- most people believe that we have not yet seen the major increase in the cost of water and sewer. So, and I like to say, apparently the national rate is about $10 per 1,000 gallons. Average person's use is about 100 gallons a day, all told. So if we add that up, for a family of four the average water bill is somewhere in the low triple digits, high double-digits per month. So right then and there, if there are low-cost, no-cost ways that we can save 20, 30 percent of that, that's very welcome savings. But in a program like Zero Energy Ready Homes, where we're very much thinking about what technologies and what resources do we need to put in these homes, so that they can perform 50 years from now, well, what's water going to cost in 20, 30, 40, 50 years? And at what point does that go from being very welcome savings and it's nice to have, to really being something that we can't afford to not do? In my opinion, I think we're really knocking on the door here. And certainly in 20 years, I think we're not going to be able -- people are not going to be able to afford water-gushing homes.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So it's also important to remember, and Jamie touched on this briefly, is that saving water is not just about saving the gallons of water. We spend a tremendous amount of energy delivering and treating clean water, and treating wastewater on the other end, in addition to heating water inside of our homes. Nationally, we spend about 3 to 4 percent of the entire grid on treating and moving water. In certain parts of the country it's even higher. In California, we spend 20 percent of all energy on simply getting water around to where it needs to be. It's also a major cost for most municipalities. So there's really no doubt about it, that water and energy are really connected in a very inextricable way. And that's why WaterSense is here. We're here because we need water efficiency. We're going to need to meet our infrastructure challenges. We're going to need it to protect our communities from drought. And we're going to need it to protect consumers, who aren't going to be able to afford to consume water at the same rate they're doing it now, when utility prices continue to rise. So the WaterSense label is here to identify products in addition to homes that are third-party certified in both efficiency and performance.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The performance aspect is obviously very important. Most of us are probably old enough to remember the first-generation low-flow toilets that didn't work all that well. Because we're now able to actually put performance criteria into the specification, that's rapidly becoming a thing of the past. So when you look for the WaterSense label, you can know that the product is both very efficient and high- performing. We also aim to promote water efficiency behaviors and actions. Of course, in doing so we help save consumers money. We reduce the need to expand infrastructure in the future, and we're able to save water for critical needs as a nation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Let's talk a little bit more about what the actual requirements are for WaterSense Labeled Homes. Just a couple of quick relatively administrative notes. Most people -- it sounded like most people weren't too familiar with the WaterSense Labeled program. For those that are and may have seen, we did release a revision this past July. Revision 1.2. And all that does is actually reflect changes that we made in our irrigation partnership program. So no real substantive changes to the requirements. I just want people to know. There's no reason to go circling back to your projects that might be seeking the WaterSense label right now and reviewing all of the criteria. It's really just a change that reflects the updates to the irrigation partners. We touched on on this briefly. Thanks for the question that we got. Homes that are eligible for a WaterSense Labeled Home, are both single-family homes and townhomes, as well as homes in multifamily buildings that are up to three stories in size. Or more than three stories, providing that the units have independent heating, cooling, and hot water systems, separate from other units. That's not to say that you can't have a very efficient building using a central boiler. Or other central systems. But our criteria really isn't set up to capture the water use associated with those, so that's all that we can apply the WaterSense label to. And it does apply to both new construction and existing homes, but, as I mentioned, the criteria remains the same. So it is a little bit of a heavier lift for existing homes. How we third-party certify homes. The program has an administrator, which is RESNET, just as the HERS system does, for those -- many of you are familiar with it. There is a provider role, just as there is in -- there is accredited rating providers. There are approved WaterSense providers. And finally, there's the water efficiency inspector who might be independent, might work directly with the rater, who actually physically comes and does the inspection, and most of the time that's actually a HERS rater. And I would say for those of you who are interested in pursuing the label, the thing to do is to work through your existing relationships. If you are builder, I'd talk to your existing raters and find out if it's something that they offer or something they're planning to offer in the future. If you're a rater, then certainly talk to your provider and find out if they're also a WaterSense label provider, since there's a good chance that they are, and they can provide the training and do the quality assurance so you're able to do inspections and offer your clients the label. If you are a provider and you're interested, feel free to contact me. You can also contact RESNET directly but we'd be happy to walk you through the process.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what do we require in a WaterSense Labeled Home? Well, of course, we require WaterSense labeled products. Like I said, those are one of those really easy ways to add both performance and efficiency to a home. They're third-party certified for both efficiency and performance, so you know they're going to save water. In the case of showers and faucets, you know they're going to save energy by using less water.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />You know that they're going to perform well. They're available for -- you can find the label on showerheads, faucets, and toilets. Products are available at literally every price point. And like I said, it's just a very easy, most of the time no-cost, way to add both efficiency and performance, resulting in a better performing home. We also have requirements for leak prevention and service pressure. I'll talk a little bit about those. Again, one of those instances where a small change in behavior and a small change in practices on the construction side can really lead to a tremendous amount of value down the line, in terms of making sure that you're delivering a home that's free of leaks and is going to continue to perform well. We'll talk a little bit more in-depth about hot water distribution in a second, but as I mentioned before, that is one of the required elements of Zero Energy Ready Homes. Of course, all homes to bear the label are third-party certified, and they all feature smart landscaping and efficient, if it's included, irrigation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So does anyone know what this little device is, over here? Name something like it? It's a pressure gauge. Costs about $10 at any plumbing supply store, and we use this to do a pressure loss test in the inspection process. So, it's really simple to do. Hook it up to a hose bib. You might have to go into the laundry hookup, if there's a separate irrigation outside on a separate loop. But hook it up to the hose bib. Shut up the water at the main shutoff. And go back and look at the pressure gauge. The reason we're doing this, if you think about it, the plumbing system is a closed system. If the pressure is changing when the water is shut off to the rest of the public supply system, it's got to be getting out someplace. So if the pressure is fluctuating, then somebody's using water. Water is getting out to the system somehow. And if no one is actively using water, that means that you have a leak. I'd love to tell you that this test never comes back positive on new homes. That's just not true. We find leaks in new homes all the time. It's not always what we expect. When we talk about leaks, everyone tends to think about 10,000 gallons in the basement. But the reality is, more times than not, the leak is a toilet flapper that's installed a little bit askew. Or it's a faucet that drips just enough -- not so much that you catch it in a quick walk-through, but enough so that the sum total of that, of the water that's escaping from it, is substantial when it's dripping 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So again, only takes a few minutes, doesn't cost anything, and yet it's a great way to check and make sure that the home you're delivering actually doesn't leak.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another thing we check for when do that is service pressure. Now, this makes people nervous because people often complain about pressure in the shower. That's why we don't like low-flow showerheads, because they don't have enough pressure. What people characterize as pressure in that sense is really force. We're talking about with what level of force the water hits their body. Typically code will let you go anywhere from 45 to 85 psi. And all we've done with WaterSense is we've restricted a little bit, down to 60 psi. The reason that we've done that, is that A, there's a water savings there. The products aren't going to flow above the maximum threshold when we do that. B, it reduces the likelihood of leaks. Again, and is a little bit safer for the home. But also, WaterSense labeled products are tested at their performance level all the way down to 45 psi. The 60 psi, or the 45 to 60 psi, is more than enough to make sure that they're still performing with adequate force. The other nice thing this does is provides a little bit of insurance against fluctuations that might be happening in the public supply system. So, a lot of times when we're working on new home construction, we're dealing with areas that are expanding. And multiple homes are being brought online and being hooked up to the system, and they're experiencing changes in terms of the pressure at the point of delivery. So installing a -- excuse me -- a PRV is another way to make sure that the experience that the homeowner or the occupant has inside the home doesn't change over time and doesn't result in callbacks. There's another thing we do in WaterSense Labeled Homes that I really love. And it's homeowner / occupant education. We have a great template we provide to our builder partners that makes it very easy to pass on all the information about the technology that the homeowner's going to need to know to maintain all the technology, all the equipment, and all of the great water-saving features of that home. As a homeowner, personally the reason I love this is, I spent the last two years trying to recreate this in my home. And we've given builders a great way to do it in a really simple, easy manner, which again, just is a tremendous added value to the homeowner.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />OK, I'm going to jump into hot water distribution. And again, this is part of the WaterSense requirements that have been drafted and are required in the WaterSense Labeled Homes. Excuse me, is required in Zero Energy Ready Homes. So you heard Jamie provide a little bit of background in it. I think we've all experienced this. This is when Mr. and Mrs. Jones wakes up in the morning. They go take the shower. They turn on their hot water, and they wait. And they're waiting because the water's not actually hot. It used to be hot. It's coming from the hot water system. But what's happened is, it's been pumped out into the walls and allowed to cool down, and we need to wait for fresh hot water to get there. Huge waste of energy, huge waste of water. Poor-performing solution. So the requirement that we have in WaterSense Labeled Homes is that we're not going to allow any more than a half-gallon of water between the furthest fixture and the source of hot water. And when we do a test, we're actually going to test it at 0.6. We've going to give it 20 percent, because you're going to lose some water, you're going to lose some heat as the water moves through the system, and there's going to be just a little bit of water stored in the actual product.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So we do test that at a different level than the requirement actually says. We do allow recirculation systems, but we do require that they're demand initiated. So they need to be push-button, or motion-sensitive or a motion sensor. We also allow sort of this new breed of schedule adaptive water heaters. So these are water heaters which almost -- I liken them to a nest thermostat. They learn the tendencies and practices of the home, and they're able to recirculate based on that information. We don't allow products that are simply timer or temperature based recirculation systems. So products that have temperature gauges and say, OK, well, water's at 85 degrees, I'm going to spin the water around the loop. Or products that simply say, OK, 7 a.m., I'm going to recirculate the water. The reason we don't allow those is, No. 1, there's really conflicting information about how much water those actually save. Because it's so varied, based on the individual practices of the home. The other is that we do know that they have the potential to use a lot of energy. So even though WaterSense obviously is a water efficiency program, we certainly don't want to be using energy in the name of water efficiency. And so we do prohibit those types of technologies. So once again, I'm going to take a step back, and I'm going to ask why do we even need this requirement? Why did we get to the point where the solutions that we're putting in most homes are so poor performing?</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />I think one of the ways to look at this is -- let's look at how we use energy, and how that's changed over say a 30- year period. On the left side you see energy use in 1978. And on the right side, you see that same pie chart representing energy use in 2006. So it's another one of those things that sort of makes the rounds and you see articles about it. And usually the storyline is about how good of a job we've done in reducing the energy we use (inaudible). And that's true. We've made tremendous strides as an industry. We have more efficient heating elements now than we used to. We do a better job of building envelope, insulation, and using that energy after we've generated it, efficiently. The energy we spend on air conditioning has gone up quite a bit, but I think we all understand that's because we have more air conditioners. And of course, we use more on appliances and electronics but simply because we plug so many different things in nowadays. But what I find really interesting is that both as a percentage and as a total use, water heating has gone up. Now, why would that be? Is there anyone who thinks that we had less-efficient water heaters in 2006 than we did in 1978? Probably not. What about the use? Well, our products are a lot more efficient than they were in 1978. In 1978 the average showerhead flowed at probably somewhere around five gallons per minute. In 2006, the national standard was already two and a half gallons per minute. So they were flowing at two and a half gallons per minute, maximum. We were pretty close to having WaterSense labeled showerheads, which we have today, which flow at a maximum two gallons per minute. So we're doing a better job heating water. We're doing a better job using water. Why are we getting less efficient overall? Now, part of the answer to that is probably that we have more hot water-using appliances than we used to. We have more washing machines. We have more dishwashers than we used to have. But we're also continuing to put the same technology that we used to put into 1,200-square-foot, one-bathroom bungalows into much larger homes. And it's no longer an appropriate strategy.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So, here's my very simplified example of a trunk and branch distribution system. This is how my grandfather plumbed houses, and probably what he told you was the way to do it until the day he died. I think it's helpful to think about this in three phases. Again, we have the water heater, where we're going to actually generate hot water, taking energy, usually electricity or natural gas, and we're converting it to heat. On the other hand, we have the actual fixture, where we're going to use the hot water. And we can affect efficiency at both of those ends, right? I can generate the water more efficiently, through a more efficient hot water heater. I can use the water more efficiently, through things like WaterSense labeled products. But I also have to get the hot water from A to B. And I have to move it from the source to the actual fixture. And I can also affect the efficiency of this system there. So, in the example of my simple trunk and branch system, back into my 1,200-square-foot, one-bathroom bungalow, which is what my grandfather plumbed, by the way, I might have a 10-foot trunk. That's a big, say, one-inch wide copper pipe coming out of the water heater. And then I'm going to have a smaller, three-quarter-inch branch coming off of that, and that might be five feet or so. And then I'll have a couple feet of a twig. So knowing those lengths, I can tell how much volume of water is stored in the system. A little bit cumbersome to do. One of the things we got a lot of requests from the Zero Energy Ready Homes community, was for some sort of calculator, which we've now built and made available. So I can go ahead and I can plug all my numbers in. And like I said, if I have got a 10-foot trunk at one-inch copper pipe, and a five-foot branch of three-quarter-inch copper pipe, along with a couple feet of a twig or very small diameter, half-inch copper pipe, in total I'm storing about 73.5 ounces, which is just above the WaterSense criteria of a half-gallon. So, now remember, if this is back in say 1950 and I'm plumbing this house, I've got a five-gallon permanent showerhead on there. So not only is my plumbing system not that large just because my house isn't that large, and I don't have that many fixtures that need to surface, I'm able to bleed the water through really pretty quickly. Because I've got this big old inefficient showerhead on there. So, I'm going to get hot water pretty quickly in that instance, right? I don't have that much water stored in the system. I've got a big old, inefficient showerhead that's going to draw it out really quickly. And so, hot water is going to get there pretty fast. It's a really inefficient system. It's a waste of water, it's a waste of energy, because of the flow rate that I'm using on the showerhead, but it's going to work. It's going to perform for me and meet my expectations. What happens if I take that same technology and I put it into, say, a 2,300-square-foot, two-bathroom home? Well, now instead of having the 10-foot trunk, I might have a 15- or 20-foot trunk.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And instead of having a five-foot branch, I might have a 10-foot branch. And I'll probably only still have a few feet of a twig, but all said and done, I'm going to be up at a few hundred ounces. And because I have a more efficient showerhead on there now, which is a good thing, right -- the more efficient showerhead saves water, saves energy -- but I'm not going to be able to compensate for that poorly performing system in the same way. Because I'm not going to bleed the water out. Well, now I'm over a minute and a half, that I have to wait for hot water to get there. And I'm watching three gallons go down the drain every time I need to get hot water. So one of the things we find is that typically, the person in this home isn't going to stand there and wait a minute and a half, two minutes, for hot water. They're going to develop coping mechanisms. So they're going to turn the hot water on and they're going to go brush their teeth. They're going to turn on the water and go get their clothes ready for the day. Turn on the water, go start the coffee.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And so the waste is going to be even greater. Now, another thing I want to point out is that currently, HERS doesn't really reflect that poor performing system. And so I can put information about the water heater in, and HERS will reflect that. But it's not going to reflect the fact that my system is high-performing or low-performing as a whole. That's something that's changing, both in terms of providing performance to the homeowner but also in terms of making sure it doesn't adversely impact your HERS scores. This is something that's really going to have to be adjusted for most of us in the future.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />I want to look a little bit at how this might play out in some of the homes. So in this instance, I have a relatively simple three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home. So again, not a terribly large home. But the nice thing that's happened in this layout, is you'll notice, most of my places where I'm going to need not just hot water but the systems of the home, so things like exhaust and hot water and gas, are all clustered together. For those of you who are familiar with Passive House techniques, it's very similar to the technique they use there. You want to group the places that have those higher system demands in a place where you can easily service them. So that's what's happened in this home. And because of that, I've done the math for it here, and you can see the different runs and lengths of piping, and for the most part, everything is under that half-gallon. Half-gallon in ounces is about 64 ounces. So everything falls at or below that half-gallon requirement. And you can look at some estimated wait times based on that, as well. Now, we can agree, 45 seconds is not exactly the gold standard.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Sadly, it's a lot better than what the typical home performs at now. But the thing that we see happen in the field all the time is that the designer might come in, and they say, you know what, we really need that bathroom to be over there on that side. Or we want the half-bath in the laundry room to be over to the left because it creates a better flow. Which is fine; those are all important things and important aspects of selling the home. But now look at how far I have to run from the water heater over to get to the bathrooms on the second floor. Now again, I'm storing up over a gallon of water in the pipes. And I'm up over a minute of standing there at the shower waiting for hot water to arrive. So we're getting back into that range where we have to wonder, is the person really going to be satisfied with that? Are they going to stand there and wait for hot water to arrive, or are they going to develop coping mechanisms? And so again, we're wasting water, we're wasting energy. We're building poor-performing homes.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Some of the other options we have. Like I said, I understand that adjusting the layout of the home, preventing adjustments to the layout of the home, isn't always an option. We can use a whole-house manifold. And these have individual runs to different fixtures, which allow us to reduce the length of the pipes -- I'm sorry, the diameter of the pipe -- quite a bit. So if I'm to put these back into my nice layout and everything, because I'm able to reduce the diameter of the pipes going out to the individual fixtures, I don't have to store as much water in them. And so I'm able to really reduce both the volume of water that I'm storing and the wait time that I'm going to experience trying to get hot water at those individual fixtures. There's downsides to this type of system, too. You don't get that consecutive use benefit. So in my other system, if, you know, there's a family living in this house, and Mrs. Jones wakes up first, goes and takes her shower, and then early in the morning, and then Mr. Jones comes in and he uses the other bathroom because he got kicked out of the master bath, well, that will already be primed to a degree, because water would have been drawn upstairs by the first event. That doesn't happen in the same way in a whole-house manifold system. So there's been a tradeoff here, but we've been able to deliver water much more quickly.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then, I'm not going to show a diagram of it, but if I were to install on-demand recirculation, I'd really be getting those wait times down. So the point that I want to make here, and we have all sorts of resources available on the WaterSense site. I provided a link to them before. We have a whole guide that gets into exactly how to design distribution systems and the different -- what type of system might be appropriate in a different type of house.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />But what I really want to underscore is that we can look at four different strategies for more or less the same three- bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house, and yet our wait times, especially for those upstairs fixtures, are ranging anywhere from six or seven seconds up to 65 seconds. So we've created a huge variation not just in how much water is going to be wasted, not just in how much energy is going to be wasted, but also in terms of how well the house performs by going from one design to another and one distribution technique to another.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I always like to leave people with just a few things to remember when they talk about distribution systems. And I know this is mostly something that gets delegated to the plumber. The No. 1 is you really have to do the math. You've got to get the design and you've got to figure out how much water is going to be stored -- going to be in the system -- simply because it is an energy-intensive system. And we do have to think about how efficiently it's going to be able to perform both now and in the future. Another reason I like to tell people to do this is that if there's no plan, then right then and there, we know there's a problem. Because once again, this is too intensive, too resource-intensive of a system, too expensive to install, and it's going to have too much of a lasting impact on the performance of the home, to be determined by whether or not the plumber felt like going left or right on a Tuesday morning. So in order to do the math, you have to make sure you have the numbers. And I've received hundreds, and probably at this point thousands, of different plumbing designs from different builder partners throughout the course of running the program. I think 99 times out of 100, those plans, which are done in CAD, they have some work and some thought put into them, don't have run lengths on them. So if I were a builder or if I was someone working on a project, the first thing I would do if I got a plumbing design with no numbers on it, is I would hand it back, and I would say, I need the numbers. And that sends a message, as well. It sends a message that, yes, we're paying for this type of system, and you're going to be held accountable for it. That's a message that's not communicated to plumbers typically. The only message plumbers usually get is plumb this. Do this quickly, and to do it as quickly as possible. Get in, get out, and plumb it. That's something that really needs to change when you think about the long-lasting impacts of the system. So in addition to sort of doing the math and getting the numbers, you need to let the plumber know why you're asking for them. And to know that they are going to be held accountable, to make sure that the system is installed and it's going to perform the way that we want. And finally, I always encourage people, make sure the homeowner knows what they're getting. It's one of those problems that, everyone's familiar with this problem. But no one really thinks too much about it. We're pretty good at developing those coping mechanisms. But it's important for homeowners and occupants to understand why their house is performing better than others and why they no longer have to wait for the hot water to get there. So I want to make sure we save some time for questions at the end. So let's touch really briefly on some of the outdoor and irrigation requirements. One of the great things about outdoors is that I think that this is another place where we're really able to add a lot of convenience and performance to a home, for really relatively minor incremental costs. We don't require irrigation systems in WaterSense Labeled Homes, but if there is one, we do have a requirement that needs to be met, which include WaterSense labeled weather-based irrigation controllers. We also have a professional requirement there that requires it be designed or installed and audited by a certified professional. That audit is another one of those great requirements. I'll tell you right now, the No. 1 sort of fail that we get, that we find from the audit process is that the products installed are not what the builder ordered. And so in essence, builders are spec-ing X, paying for X, and Y is getting installed. So obviously it's something that really needs to be done, and hopefully we'll create some change in the industry over time.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Here's a quick shot of a WaterSense water budget tool. This is the calculator, so to speak, that we use to determine whether or not the landscape is efficient. Again, a great way to provide -- it allows enough flexibility to develop a beautiful landscape that's regionally appropriate, that's going to be easy to maintain over time. So 1 out of 10 people has a green thumb, really enjoys being out there working in the yard. Most of us just will not spend our weekend mowing the lawn, and that's one of the great things that WaterSense Labeled Homes allows you to do. Lets you have that beautiful lawn that you can feel good about and be proud in your home without taking a huge investment of time, energy, and money to maintain.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Real quick, I just want to point out some of the resources that we have available. Everything is available on our website, which you see a link to there. You can check out the inspection and verification guidance, the inspection checklists, and all of the guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Those are also available on the Zero Energy Ready Home site. Giving you just a couple more links for you to check out. I know it can be a little difficult to find all the information. For those of you who are interested in joining as a builder partner, maybe becoming an inspector or provider, we do provide a number of tools for you, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Everything from press release templates and website language, the use of a partner logo, and online materials.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />A couple quick examples of some of the kind of funner materials that we provide. On the left here is what most of us think of historically, with low flow, but because we're able to tease out what actually makes a high-performing showerhead from a low-performing showerhead, we can test that. We can ensure that showerhead and other products that bear WaterSense label actually perform well and you're saving water.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another one which really highlights just how frustrating it can be to wait for hot water in the morning, this little water droplet, her name is Flo. She's our spokesgal, and you see her in a lot of our materials.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And just a nice way to really highlight the low-maintenance features of the landscapes that are included in WaterSense Labeled Homes. Most of us, again -- 1 out of 10 of us loves working in the yard, but most of us would just as soon be on the hammock relaxing rather than spending all of our time dealing with it. This is my information. I'm happy to answer any questions. We also staff a helpline. Despite my very best efforts to get back to people quickly, sometimes the helpline is quicker at it. But feel free to contact me directly. That's by no means meant to discourage you. And I think I've probably saved a few minutes to field any questions. Did I do OK, there, Jamie?</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Yea, that's perfect, Jonah. Let me air out a couple questions we had come in. There are several good ones. First off, jumping back to the option of using a hot water recirculation system. We have the question, what sort of features or aspects should you look for in selecting a hot water recirc system?</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />The No. 1 thing really is that it has a demand initiation. So typically that will either be a motion sensor or a push button.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And what we're looking for there is really some indication to the system that someone's actually physically present in the room, and that there is a demand and a need for hot water. The other thing which I'll add, which is separate from our requirements, is that people really like the push-button. It can have an air of luxury to it, something that most homes can't do. Those people are actually able to "summon" hot water and know that it's going to be there right when they need it. So it's a great option. It seems like it would have sort of an education barrier on it. For that reason, a lot of times in something like a half-bath that might be used by guests, people tend to use motion sensors. But certainly in private bathrooms that are more likely to be used by homeowners and people that live in the home, the push-button tends to be very popular.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK, thank-you. And within the spec also, it's required to have that signal of a true demand, whether it's push- button, whether it's motion sensor, in all bathrooms, right? Or is it just at the furthest fixture from the hot water source?</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />It's a good question. All of the fixtures have to meet that demand requirement. So it could be in a layout that it might not be necessary to recirculate water to every fixture. But that fixture still needs to be under the half-gallon requirement.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />So that's something you can ease out using the Excel-based tool you're showing, to add different plumbing lengths for layout?</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />In recirculation systems, the source, which is normally the heater, becomes the loop. Becomes the recirculation loop. And so if a fixture isn't on that recirculation loop, then the source for that fixture is still the heater. And it's still going to need to be under a half-gallon.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />One more on the recirc system. Is there any risk of back- flow problems with the use of an on-demand water recirc system?</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />I don't want to say no, because I can think of some -- I don't want to say outright no, because I can think of some instances where it might happen. It would not be due to the recirculation pump. It would be due to other issues with the design of the plumbing system. So the installation of a recirculation pump is not going to create back-flow problems.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK. Just wrapping up, going outside the home, you touched quickly on the exterior water conservation measures. There was a couple questions as to does the program allow or discourage lawns in extremely arid areas, like the Southwest, Nevada, Arizona?</p>
<p><em>Jonah Schein:</em><br />We do allow lawns. But what the water budget's going to do is make sure that it's a regionally appropriate lawn. So it's not going to allow you to have two acres of turf grass in the Southwest. Because it's going to take your zip code and it's going to pull in climate data based on that zip code. And so it's going to allow you to have some grass, but it's not going to allow you to have too much. Another thing that it's going to do is it's going to become more forgiving if you are willing to make planting and -- if there's an irrigation system included -- irrigation choices which are more efficient. So if what you're after is having a lawn in the Southwest, you're probably going to have to be really efficient with the rest of your space to be able to do that. Because it's only going to allot you so much water. And it's going to know that a lawn in a very arid climate is going to require quite a bit of water. So it's one of the really nice things about the tool, is that it does allow you to have some flexibility. It's not going to outright prohibit lawns, but it is going to put the burden on you to show that you have a regionally appropriate lawn. It's not going to be an enormous water hog. And that's another feature that I really like about WaterSense Labeled Homes. One of the things we see happening more and more throughout the country is watering restrictions, which have traditionally been a thing for the Southwest, are starting to pop up all over the country. Usually, infrastructure and water is just like infrastructure and energy. Everything is based on peak demand. Peak demand is usually driven by irrigation. So we're starting to see, even near where I live, in the D.C. area, we're starting to see watering restrictions. The landscape of a WaterSense Labeled Home is much better equipped to handle those watering restrictions and continue to look good and survive, quite frankly, because the typical -- in a lot of cases, the "typical" home we see installed in new construction, the typical landscape we see installed in new construction, doesn't have much of a chance of surviving if really harsh watering restrictions come into play. So when you talk about cost savings, well, that homeowner now has to replace their entire landscaping. And so that's really, really a significant cost, as opposed to the homeowner of a WaterSense Labeled Home, whose landscape is able to weather having less water. And, you know, the grass might turn brown and the flowers might not bloom quite as well, but it survives.</p>
