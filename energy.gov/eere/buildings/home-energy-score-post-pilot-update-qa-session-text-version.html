<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />The first question I have here is, how do you choose and recruit partner organizations? Well, we're in the process of doing that right now. For instance, we talked to the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (I'm hoping I'm getting that name right), a group of utilities and home performance programs, and we're seeking therefore to utilities to both private-sector utilities as well as munis and others. We're talking to nonprofits who deliver energy improvement programs in the field. And of course, state and local governments, who also run programs. So those are the primary places we're looking, and some are coming to us, and in some cases we're going to them. But that's what we're in the process of doing right now. I wouldn't say there's any specific criteria other than, you know, having experience in the field. And there are criteria that -- there are going to be some co-responsibilities that we ask partners to agree to. We'll have like a partner agreement that we sign on both ends, on DOE's side and on the partner organization's side. And they're pretty straightforward. We're still in the process of finalizing those, but it would include obviously some requirements for quality assurance, and then requirements about what you can use from the Home Energy Score and what's required, what's not. And then also some targets in terms of numbers of homes that would be assessed per year.</p>
<p>Next question. Will BPI-certified professional building analysts be qualified, and if not, will there be a training schedule made available for scheduling training classes? Well, under the current process that we've used for the pilot, we did require that the assessors have either BPI certification or were HERS raters. And that will continue. We're looking at whether or not other kinds of certification would be eligible, as well. And we are probably going to make a change as we roll out nationally, which is that, in the pilot phase we had a fairly short exam that you can take online. And it was basically to just make sure that you understood what the program was and how to use the scoring tool and all that. But we probably are going to have another test that will test a little bit more in the area of building science. Because what we found was that, you know, you really did need to know some building science. Even though it's a pretty straightforward tool, you have to have some good experience and judgment in making some of the measurements and being able to make logical inputs to the tool. (Other voices talking.)</p>
<p><em>Jessica from CNT Energy:</em><br />I'm Jessica (inaudible). I work for CNT Energy in Chicago. We were one of the pilots. And our main goal was to ensure that the tool accurately represented the energy use of single-family homes in the Chicago metro region, as our homes are old, leaky, and very gas-intensive. CNT Energy has done a considerable amount of research on the housing stock and the measures of energy use characteristics of the homes in the region. We have a data set of about half a million homes that enables us to describe the entire population, including structural characteristics and energy use, to understand how individual homes fit into the whole population. So for the pilot we scored 111 homes. The median age of our homes was 1924, and we're located primarily in the city of Chicago with some homes scored in the surrounding suburbs. We had six assessors working on the pilot. Primary assessor observations were that it was relatively easy to collect data in the field for the program. They estimated it was about 20 minutes of additional work to their already-scheduled field work. They were really helpful in identifying several improvements to the tool interface and training, especially ones that were confusing or maybe inputs that weren't particularly applicable to our region. As far as homeowner observations, we surveyed the homeowners both pre- and post-score, and had a 31 percent response rate on the post-score. For us, the homeowners were really excited to participate in the program and to sort of get out ahead of curve. We did use the recommendations as part of the pilot. The homeowners didn't trust the recommendations as much. They didn't feel that they were customized to their specific home as they would have wanted them to be. And most if not all homeowners did not understand the source energy number that was provided on the label. Most participants were motivated to improve and cross the average score jump that a participant could have gotten from improvements is about two to four points. We also did some analysis similar to Minnesota on operational energy use. We do have the utility billing data for the 111 homes in the pilot. And we're working to provide NREL that data to use it to calibrate their tool and improve the gas prediction accurately. So that is how Chicago did.</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />Great. There seems to be one question for you. ... I don't know if you heard that, but the question was, how were the 111 homes selected?</p>
<p><em>Jessica from CNT Energy:</em><br />Right. So we had the pilot layered on top of an energy efficiency program that we were running, offering air sealing and insulation rebates to customers and the people of Statton territory. So providing the score to them was done at site visits (inaudible).</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />Great. And if we have other questions for the pilots, we'll try to bring those up as we go along. I should mention, because I forgot to mention after Jenny spoke, and also now what you said, Jessica, that, as I said, the pilots were a great source of information for us. And we have used what they found out through their experience to really strengthen, I think, what we're offering and planning to offer through a national launch. And so for instance, I think, Jenny mentioned the fact that there was some overprediction using the scoring tool but that it was in this general overall good range. We've actually been able to update quite a bit of the defaults that we were using. We realized that we were overestimating natural gas usage pretty -- more than we should be, obviously. And so we rerun the scores and these data that we got from the pilot homes, and we can show that in an analysis that we'll be issuing later this fall. And basically it's the predictions of energy use are pretty significantly down. They all stayed in the same relative scale but I think they were much closer to what people were finding in terms of real usage. And the other thing we learned from the pilots was that, as Jenny and Jessica both mentioned, I think in the case of Minnesota, there was a one and a half to two point jump that most of the homes could make. And I think if I heard you right, Jessica, you said about a one-point jump.</p>
<p><em>Jessica from CNT Energy:</em><br />Basically about three points was the average jump.</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />About three points. I'm sorry. I guess I should remember that. So what we found was that -- what we heard (I hope I'm speaking correctly for the pilots) is that one of the things they were hearing was I think, if somebody scored fairly low, we do not want that to be a disincentive for them to actually take action. So I think one of the things we're learning is that we need to make sure that, as the information is being presented to the homeowners and the materials that are provided, makes it really clear that as important as your score is, the main thing is really to get to as good as your home possibly could get. You might not have a home that would eventually be a 10, but if you're a 4 today, and you can make cost-effective improvements that could get you to a 6 or 7, that still makes a lot of sense. And we're seeing if we have enough data -- although this is going to be I think a little bit difficult -- but it's possible to show how homes of that type or of that era or similarity, how those perform. Right now the only reference point on the Home Energy Score is the reference point showing you what the top 20 percent of homes of your size, how they perform. We think that's a useful motivator, but it might be even better if we could basically tell a homeowner how they compare to like homes, not just similar-sized homes but other homes of their type. OK. We have a question for Kevin. ...</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />The question for Kevin Galligan is, do (inaudible) compare your score with actual fuel use, which we would assume was oil. Kevin?</p>
<p><em>Kevin Galligan:</em><br />We do have a diverse demographic, as far as fuel use. We had a mix of both space heating and domestic hot water fuel types that included, as the question notes, oil, natural gas, propane, and electricity. We did not get to the operational analysis level like our fellow partners, but we're certainly -- we could if we put some time into it. It's been one thing to make promises and follow through, but that was one thing that we just tried not to overcommit, to that. But we certainly could do that data analysis. Our thought is, once we do see the official evaluation results, particularly if customers are more motivated to take the asset rating and more operationalize it. Since it does have a fit within our existing energy efficiency program, which is a comprehensive assessment, blower door, the whole bit. We think we could actually merge the two together. So there's a really good synergy between our existing program and adding the Home Score.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />Thank-you very much, Kevin.</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />OK, great. And I should say that although we don't have time to go through it now, as I said, we're going to be issuing a paper. We're doing a lot of analysis with NREL of both the data we received from the pilot but also other utility bill and home characteristic data that we've been able to collect with the help of various other partners out there, Which we really appreciate. So NREL has been doing some analysis that looks at the extent to which operational effects really do impact the spread that you might see in a house in terms of energy use. They're also looking at how closely the Home Energy Score, now that we've made the changes, how well it aligns to actual utility bills. Not the ones the pilots had, because we didn't have those, for the most part we didn't. But for some others that we've collected. OK, so getting back to these questions. I'm afraid we're not going to get through everything, but I'll try to get through as many as I can.</p>
<p>OK, is DOE planning to partner with home inspection organizations and allow home inspectors to deliver the Home Energy Score? That gets really back to what I was saying about the certification levels that will be required for the assessors. If home inspectors can meet those levels of training and expertise, then I would imagine they will be allowed to participate. At this point, we're really trying to participate with organizations. For instance, it actually was a home -- another on the line, I believe, a home inspector's organization or association that wanted to now be involved, we would consider working with them. And then if some of their members met that criteria, then we could do it. It just depends on each -- although we might partner with an organization, each individual working for that organization that delivers the Home Energy Score still needs to meet and pass the test that we would require to provide the Home Energy Score at the local level.</p>
<p>OK, to what extent is the Home Energy Score currently available throughout the U.S.? It is not available throughout the U.S. right now because we've just been pilot-testing it. At this point, basically no one's providing it. We stopped the pilots in July, and as I said, we're doing an analysis of what we found out before we make additional changes and before we go to a national launch.</p>
<p>Somebody said there were online training courses that were being offered to get someone to be then eligible to provide the Home Energy Score? I know there have been some things out there that we've seen. Basically the only official online training course is the one that we offer right now, or will offer in the future. And then any kind of testing would have to come through DOE. At this point there are no other official training courses. At the same time, people can offer kinds of training courses that could possibly help you learn more about building science or you can learn about the tool, but these are not officially endorsed by DOE.</p>
<p>Is it possible to email the label to the consumer and have them print it at their home in this process? Someone asked that, I think, because they were concerned that some assessors might not have access to printers and computers. You certainly can email the label to the homeowner, and many of the pilots did that. Some of them mailed them to them, or some of them printed them out at the time of the assessment. So it can be done any of those ways. If they were looking for somebody other than the qualified assessor to enter the data, we'd have to figure out how to do that, and make sure that we have some kind of quality assurance taking place there, as well.</p>
<p>OK. Bear with me while I find my next question. Somebody asked about whether RECS was the only source we were using. We used a combination of RECS data from 2005 as well as other analysis we did to come up with the ranges that correspond to the bins for each of the 19 climate zones. And so we are hopeful that we can get some of the 2009 data, as well, and are working with EIA to try to do that. Although it hasn't been released at this point. It's not that the Home Energy Score is really driven by RECS. It's just one source of data that we use to inform how we came up with the ranges. And we are adjusting the bins based on what we found out in the pilots, as well as because we just made these changes to the defaults, which obviously change how the outcome comes in terms of energy use calculation.</p>
<p>Alright. I'm trying to find the next question. OK. Somebody asked when we estimate the program to be rolled out to the public. Well, we plan to have national launch later this fall. That doesn't mean it would be open to any homeowner. Obviously, it would be, any homeowner who could get access to a qualified assessor could then get it. And if that's what you're talking about, that's in terms of the public.</p>
<p>OK, there was a question here as to whether blower door tests were required. During the pilot program, as Jenny mentioned, Minnesota and many of the other -- or several of the other -- pilots did conduct blower door tests. And what we did and are doing right now is looking at the sensitivity of using either the blower door actual number or just going in with either putting in the seals or unsealed in the score. And so far what we've found is that at least our preliminary understanding is that we probably will not require it, blower door tests, because there does not seem to be a significant change. But we're looking to make sure that that's true in specific regions, not just across the board.</p>
<p>What is the basis for the energy cost? Well, that's something we're probably going to be changing. The way the energy costs have been calculated to date -- oh, actually, I'm sorry, not the energy costs. OK. We're not changing that. The energy costs are based on the average state utility rates for that state, and that will not change.</p>
<p>Is there a loading order for upgrades to be recommended? Right now, and I think continuing on down the road, the way that the upgrades are ordered is based on how quickly they will pay back. So we are assuming certain costs of the measures, but what we probably are going to do is get rid of the actual payback number on the recommendation sheet. As others mentioned on the phone, you didn't -- the pilots didn't have to, and nor do the future partners have to, use our recommendations. It's meant to be there if a program is not already offering recommendations on their own. But if they choose to use our recommendations, they probably no longer will have a payback, because then you can have implied costs, and that can get tricky because we obviously don't have data on all the local costs of improvements.</p>
<p>Do climate zone differences affect the Home Energy Score? Well, what happens is that the bins, the 1 through 10 bins, correspond to a certain Btu number. The bins are adjusted for harsher climates for a higher use; you'd have a higher use so you'd have a higher number associated with those bins. So in that sense it is adjusted.</p>
<p>Does the Home Energy Score take into account renewable energy systems installed in homes such as PV? No, it does not.</p>
<p>OK, somebody asked about -- I think I've answered some of this, but they wanted to hear about the sensitivity of the results to diagnostic testing, how the HES tool compares to other tools, and what we found in terms of the scoring methodologies. As I said, what we found was that we were overestimating some of the heating energy use calculations, and so we've adjusted those. We found that we probably need to make some additional adjustments to the bins in certain climates. And in terms of how, we found that once we made the adjustments to the defaults, the Home Energy Score pretty closely aligns to utility bills to some degree, and to as I see the other tools that we looked at. We are not -- although it does align, and we're happy to see that, because it kind of gives people like a warm and fuzzy that things align with utility bills -- at the same time, that's not really what we're trying to do, because the Home Energy Score is meant to be an asset rating. And it's meant to assume that there is two adults and one child living in that home and using -- having a certain level of comfort that they're trying to achieve with thermostat settings. Obviously, people have different levels of comfort that they're trying to achieve, and they don't -- what we found is that people's behavior varies pretty significantly. And so the fact that something matches utility bills or doesn't is not necessarily an indication of the effectiveness of the tool, but we do think that it's pretty close, if that makes people feel good.</p>
<p>OK. Will there be a national-based program that includes an educational component that promotes it through community-based organizations? Well, I'm always in favor of using community-based organizations to do outreach. So if there are any that would like to be involved in doing that kind of promotion, we obviously would be interested in hearing from you and planning a way possibly to work together. I think I'll combine that with the next question, which was, how will the program be implemented and what resources / support will be available for groups to promote it? Well, we'll provide certain resources to the partners in terms of materials, in terms of some technical support. But I strongly doubt that we're going to have any funding that would go out to the partners to promote or deliver the tool. In this environment, I just don't think that we're going to be seeing that kind of implementation.</p>
<p>So the question here about who will the program be targeting. Well, the main target of the program is really homeowners. And in terms of the consumer, who we're hoping to motivate and educate. Homeowners are the ultimate target, but we believe that the best way to get to them is to work through partners like utilities and energy efficiency programs, state and local governments, and the like. Nonprofits.</p>
<p>There's a question about what the goals will be. That really depends on who the partners are and how many we have, and how large the program grows. But I think that obviously two things that we're going to hear about are, the number of homes that are scored is one thing that we'll be measuring, and also the conversion rate. Because obviously what we really want to happen is for homes to not only be scored but for people to take action and make improvements to their homes in terms of energy improvements.</p>
<p>There's a question about how we will do evaluations. That's still to be decided. We will have an evaluation plan as part of what we're -- as part of the program and its implementation plan.</p>
<p>OK. Who can I contact for more information on how we can assist with program promotion and implementation? Well, for anybody who's interested in working with us as a partner or some type of other affiliate -- it sounds like this group is interested -- what you should do is email us at <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov">HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov</a>. And if possible, in the subject line put "Partner interest" or "Partner." That will help us know that we need to get back to you. And we try to get back to everyone, but that will be very helpful. So it's <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov">HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov</a>.</p>
<p>OK. Will there be education or builder training to perform upgrades? We're not planning to take any kind of -- this is not a training program. There are a lot of training programs out there. And those of you who have worked with Benjamin Goldstein know that DOE has been in the process of creating worker certification standards and those types of associated tools that you need to make sure that workers are well- qualified. And so if you want more information about training, you can email us and we can try to get you to the right people. The training that we will offer will really be training on how to use the Home Energy Scoring Tool, how to deliver the Home Energy Score, and then the testing will be on that as well as on basic building science knowledge.</p>
<p>Ah, will Home Energy Score be used for Home Performance with ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup>? The Home Energy Score is completely voluntary, so if there are home performance programs out there that want to use it, we will be very happy to work with them. And if some do not want to use it, then that's their choice, as well.</p>
<p>How are energy savings measured? Well, the tool makes some recommendations in terms of what types of energy improvements make sense for the home. And then they're broken out into two kinds of improvement recommendations. The first type, the energy savings are looked at in terms of how much energy would be saved, once you implement that, on an annual basis, and the tool makes that kind of assumption. One thing we're probably changing is what the base case is, against how it's estimating energy savings. So we will document how that is changing, because we realize in some cases we were either overestimating or underestimating the amount of savings based on the base case it was using. In the case of replacement recommendations, which are the second tier recommendations, the energy savings are based on the incremental savings you get by buying a more efficient piece of equipment relative to a less efficient piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Can individuals participate? At this point, we're considering it, but we are a little bit concerned that working with many, many individuals will be difficult for us to manage and to maintain a good level of quality assurance. So we're interested in hearing from you and hearing how you might want to be involved. And we'd like to figure out if there's a way that either individuals could participate through other organizations that we're partnering with, or that we could figure out some ways to ensure that there will be good quality assurance. OK. Thank-you.</p>
<p>Does the software account for intermediate effects on -- oh, I'm sorry, interactive effects? OK. Yes, it does. I'm having trouble reading somebody's handwriting here.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />Are HERS II California raters certified and used to do it in other states?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />I believe they would be, yea. HERS II raters from California are likely, I would imagine, qualified to do this in other states, as well.</p>
<p>Oh, why a 1-10 scale? Aren't homes more diverse and shouldn't there be more, I guess, numbers? Yea, that's a good question. We did struggle with that in terms of whether to use a 100-point scale or some other kind of level of gradation. And what we came up with -- the reason we went to 10 is that it's pretty simple. And also what we're really trying to provide here is not a full comprehensive audit. The whole assessment is supposed to take an hour or less time. And if you're doing that kind of assessment, you're not going to get to the level of granularity that you could achieve with a larger kind of audit, and therefore we did not feel comfortable going to something with greater significant digits like 100s. Because we're going to be confident on the 10 scale, but I don't think we would be confident to tell you you're a 56 as opposed to a 5.</p>
<p>OK. Will there be low-interest financing available for improvements? My answer is a little bit similar to what I said about training. It's not a financing program, so we can certainly find out for you and try to direct you. There is still the pilot that FHA is doing, the Power Saver pilot program, and that, as far as I know, is the main source of federal financing for this, other than tax credits and the like that have been offered over time. And if you're looking for specific incentives in your area, you should go to the DSIRE website, which is dsireusa.org. So <a href="../../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.dsireusa.org.html" rel="nofollow">www.dsireusa.org</a>, but no "e" between the "d" and the "s."</p>
<p>OK. I already answered this one. ... There is a question here, do the pilots, are there are any metrics that a label produces energy savings? If you're talking about whether or not this translated into people taking improvements, it wasn't a long enough type of study for us to, and we also didn't provide that kind of resource. We didn't provide resources to the pilots. They really did this kind of out of the goodness of their hearts and their interest, which was great. So we couldn't get into creating control groups, though we really don't have that kind of information. I hope that's what you were asking.</p>
<p>OK, what are the plans to measure the impact of recommendations installed versus predicted savings? I think that's part of a bigger problem that DOE and others are tackling. Obviously, utilities have had to deal with this for a long time. And I should say that there's a lot of analysis going on in the Building Technologies program. A guy by the name of George Hernandez is putting together a very large database of commercial buildings and residential buildings, and they're looking at ways to over time be able to figure out how recommendations, and how actually -- how installed measures actually perform. So that they can give some sense of reliability and security to lenders when they're making investments. So they're looking at all kinds of -- trying to do actual area studies. But that is not part of this program.</p>
<p>What is the opinion of realtors about using past Home Energy Score as a way to sell houses? As many of you probably know, at the national level, there's been some consternation and concern that any kind of scoring program or labeling or whatever you want to call it could get in the way of selling homes. And so there is certainly no indication that that has changed, that there still is concern. And we recognize that, and so what we're really trying to push is this is a voluntary method for homeowners to learn quickly more about their home, how efficient it is, how it compares to others in their area, and hopefully be influenced by their peers and want to make improvements. So I know there's a lot going on right now with Greening the MLS and all that, but the Home Energy Score is something a little bit apart from that. And again, I should stress it's completely voluntary, and we're not trying to make it anything but voluntary.</p>
<p>Will you allow HESP, which is, I think, the Home Energy Survey Professionals, through RESNET, since there is a quality assurance requirement? You know, we tried to test the level of understanding of the Home Energy Survey Professionals, and unfortunately we didn't have an opportunity to do that. We didn't have enough -- there weren't any that we knew of in our pilot zones. But it's something we're interested in testing, so if this person wants to contact us, we can talk to you about it. I need to look more closely at what a Home Energy Survey Professional -- what level of understanding they have. And hopefully this way that we're for the building clients test might allow for a greater level of different certifications.</p>
<p>OK. I'm not sure what this question is saying. What is the ultimate goal of the Home Energy Score? Is the goal to fuel usage on new vehicles? I don't know what this means. But I'm sorry if it was transposed incorrectly, but the person here is giving me a bad look (laughs). But ... you know, the ultimate goal is to get homeowners to invest in their homes and make smart improvements that actually save energy. So that's the ultimate goal. I think what you're talking about possibly is like the MPG rating on vehicles. This is certainly something that, we're hoping for something simple that consumers can understand quickly, the way hopefully they understand the MPG rating when they buy a car. So you're right, that it's meant to be a simple way of communicating how energy efficient a home is. OK, we're going to take a pause and Hanna Wood has some additional information for you.</p>
<p><em>Hanna Wood:</em><br />Hi, everyone. I just wanted to let you know that it's 2:30, so we have about 15 or 20 minutes left to go. We're getting a lot of questions. So please send your questions, if after the webinar, to <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov">HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov</a>. The same goes for folks who are interested in being partners. And if you can add in the subject header "Partner" or "Partner interest." An alternative email to send is <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@sra.com">HomeEnergyScore@sra.com</a>, it's Sam-Roger-Apple-dot-com. If you haven't submitted a question yet, you're welcome to do so, and we will get to that question as soon as possible. If you have any final questions for the pilots, I imagine that they'll probably need to jump off, so please submit those questions, as well. If you haven't listened to the webinar or watched the 20-minute webinar on HomeEnergyScore.gov, it's going to be up there for a while. So just go to the top right-hand screen. There's, as I mentioned, a 20-minute webinar as well as a Q&amp;A session there, so please check that out if you haven't already. So we're going to get back to the questions. Hold on one minute.</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />OK. Next question. Well, there was a question here from, I believe, InterNACHI, which is another association; I think it's the largest association of home inspectors, I believe, or top in the area. And the question again was related to home inspectors, again, we would be very happy to work with you and meet with you and talk about how that could fit into program delivery for those members who are qualified to be qualified assessors.</p>
<p>Can you customize the report and put a logo on the front page? ... We're still working out the terms of the partnerships. For instance, there is going to be certain pieces of the first page, the 10-point scale, that you'll have to use as-is. And possibly you could include a different logo on there, as well as DOE, but if you include DOE's logo, there obviously will be some restrictions as to whether you can put your own information on there. At the same time, we're trying to be as flexible as possible, so that you could incorporate this into your own type of report. I think that's really important. And we're working toward, the spring, having an API available, which would allow another entity that's using a different software tool to link to our software tool, produce the score, but then be able to put it into your own report. So there are certain things that will be required if you're using DOE's seal, but beyond that, there will be a fair amount of flexibility, and we've already provided the flexibility, and obviously if you don't want to use our recommendations, you don't need to use those.</p>
<p>Will there be one sponsor per state, or is it possible there could be multiples in the same state? I don't think there's any problem having more than one entity. Hopefully I'm not going to regret saying that. But we'd be open to working with multiple entities in a state.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />Will the final improvements be generated, show as a dollar number or as a percent savings?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />That's a good question. The question was, will the final improvement number be shown as a dollar figure as it is right now on the front page, or as a percent savings? And that was something that came up from the pilots as a recommendation. There was also some discussion of perhaps putting in like an estimated three years of savings or five years of savings as opposed to just one, because if you're going to invest in a house, you're probably going to stay there more than -- I mean, if you're going to invest in improving a house, you're probably going to stay there more than just a year. So we're still looking into that. I think the dollar amount sometimes catches people's eye more than a percent. And then they have to calculate. But I see the benefit of the percent because obviously people's usage patterns are different than, you know, different people use the house differently. So a percent could work, as well. Maybe there's a place to put percent later in the area, and we could keep the dollar number up-front.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />Are scores based upon annual consumption -- will the label show an annual consumption estimate, including fuel price consumption?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />We can put documentation about how the costs were -- and I'm sure it's already on the Web somewhere, but for those homeowners who really want to delve into the details, we can provide additional information. I don't think we're going to do anything about estimated consumption, annual consumption. Because again, the way people use their homes is differently, depending on whether you have five kids or no kids or you tend to turn your lights off or you don't. So we don't want this to be something that people are trying to match up to their bills, because that's not the intent.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />When will we be notified for training?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />You can find out more about the specifics once we do a national launch. But if you're an organization that wants to partner with us, then you can contact us now. The specifics on the training for using the Home Energy Score -- right now you can go on the Web, and there's a very short PowerPoint that was the original training. It doesn't have the test on there for the assessors who were part of the pilot. We're planning to really beef that up, because what we learned from the pilots was that some of the inputs that we were asking for were not as clear as others, and so we're making improvements to that. We're also making improvements to, when you're in the scoring tool, there's information for assessors to help guide them. So we're making additional improvements. Again, the pilots gave us great feedback. So we think it will really strengthen the program once this goes national.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />Who will monitor or enforce the QA requirements of Home Energy Score, DOE or DOE contractors?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />I don't know if you heard the person asking the question, but it was, who will enforce the QA requirements, DOE or its contractors? Again, the details of the partnership are being worked out, but probably what we're going to require is a certain percentage of a qualified assessor's -- a certain percentage of the homes scored by a qualified assessor would have to be some kind of third-party verification on those. But we will also be able to look at, for instance, if one qualified assessor comes in with all their scores as, you know, 8s, 9s, and 10s, we can see that. We can't see people's addresses, and we don't really want to see their addresses, but we can see -- we can do kind of our own analytical check to make sure that there aren't any strange things going on in terms of how homes are being scored. But the split in terms of responsibility has to be worked out with the partners, and again, we're working that out. I think we will look to the way BTI has done quality assurance. A lot of home performance programs already use that method, or they have their own methods, so we'll try to build on what's already out there, not create something new.</p>
<p><em>HES attendee:</em><br />There's a question about the registry. Can you just speak to that?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />OK. One question was about the National Home Energy Registry. We're holding off on that right now. I know it's of interest to a lot of folks, but honestly, we're kind of swamped as it is just figuring out how to launch the implementation of the program. Let alone figuring out how to deal with privacy issues and all that, that we would have to do if we have a National Home Energy Registry. And I think we certainly need to look at, you know, where that would be housed, whether it's another organization that would make more sense having that kind of information, the way Carfax, about their having information about cars. I don't know. That's not something DOE is really getting involved in at this moment.</p>
<p>What's the value of the total energy in MBtus? I don't know if I understand the question, exactly the intent. ... The reason the MBtu number is one there, is that that's the basis of the metric for which the way that you convert into the bin or what you fall into, into the 10-point score. But in terms of the value to the homeowner, that's really, you're right, it's kind of questionable, I think, since people don't really understand the Btus. I don't think they will understand KWH, either. And so what we have heard a lot in our focus groups prior to even coming up with this, was that, you know, keeping it simple was really important. And we thought we'd gotten pretty simple as it was, but we might even have to get simpler. Because people don't want information that they're not going to understand. We might provide that kind of information in terms of source energy as well as site energy on supplemental pages. And we haven't figured that out. We are using a source energy metric because we think it's the best way to motivate people to make cost-effective improvements in their homes that will lead to energy reductions that we're interested in, and greenhouse gas reductions that we're interested. Right now, the source on Btu number is based on the national conversions for the different fuel types. And we might need to move to a regional set of conversion rates for different fuel types. Which would be a little bit closer obviously to what people's real experience is.</p>
<p>OK, I think we're basically done with the main questions that came in. If we didn't answer something that you're dying to know the answer to, please email us, and we will try to get back to you. The email again is <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov">HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov</a>. And we'll probably send out a questionnaire as to whether you found this useful. So please let us know, so we can make these as useful as possible. Thank-you so much to everyone who called in, and especially to our pilot partners. Oh, I meant to open it -- I don't know if anybody else is on the phone from the other pilots, if they wanted to speak up. I hope there's an easy way to let them speak. I guess Warren from Utah, who wasn't one of our official pilots but was one of our behind-the- scenes pilots, or Diane Farrington.</p>
<p><em>Warren from Utah:</em><br />Thank, Joan. You're right. We're kind of a less-than- official pilot.</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />OK, thanks, Warren! Did you have anything to say?</p>
<p><em>Warren from Utah:</em><br />We do. We are getting to the point of the end of our ARRA funds in our Utah Home Performance program, where we did energy performance scores, which is one of our products on each home in the Home Performance program, and then we also use that data to come up with the Home Energy Score. We're currently in the process of trying to convert over from the EPS to the Home Energy Score, so we're really proud to be a part of the pilot and get ready to start issuing Home Energy Scores going forward. We think that's definitely the future of our Home Performance program, and we're very enthused to be a part of it.</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />OK, thank-you so much, Warren. We're excited to work with you. And Diane, I know she couldn't make it at the beginning. But I don't know if she's on now? Diane Farrington from the Energy Trust?</p>
<p><em>Diane Farrington:</em><br />Yea, I'm here. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><em>Joan Glickman:</em><br />Yea. Did you want to say anything?</p>
<p><em>Diane Farrington:</em><br />I'm on my iPad and I just wasn't sure if you could hear me. But I can just say that we really enjoyed using the tool as part of our assessing how to score a home. We used Energy Performance Score and this, and I knew that our assessors felt that this tool was functionally very easy to use, and I think our consumers also could relate and understand and interpret the score. We're still sort of in the evaluative process but we're likely to move forward with the Energy Performance Score, but we also appreciate the fact that if a consumer wants a Home Energy Score, we are able to deliver that for them. So we definitely would like to be able to accommodate consumer's needs. And an additional component for us that was really insightful was the recommendations report that we used on our own, was really meaningful to the homeowners, without showing them their existing condition. That appears to be what they responded most to, was understanding their current conditions in the home, so if there's a way to share that as part of the recommendations, I think that would be a great addition.</p>
<p><em>Hanna Wood:</em><br />Thank-you very much, Diane. And anything else from any of the other pilots? We just wanted to wrap up. This is Hanna Wood with Home Energy Score, supporting Joan Glickman. So Joan will most likely do another webinar later in the fall. But our main focus right now is on recruiting partners, so if you're interested, we gave you two emails. One is <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@sra.com">HomeEnergyScore@sra.com</a>, and another is <a href="mailto:HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov">HomeEnergyScore@ee.doe.gov</a>. Feel free to send an email to either of those. If you're interested in being a partner, we can follow up with more information, do individual calls. We will be holding individual or group calls with some of our stakeholders who are interested in going forward with the Home Energy Score. But once again, we just wanted to thank you for all your questions. We received over 100 questions today, so Joan Glickman is pretty valiant for answering all of those today. But again, thanks for all your participation, and thanks especially to the pilots. Good night.</p>
