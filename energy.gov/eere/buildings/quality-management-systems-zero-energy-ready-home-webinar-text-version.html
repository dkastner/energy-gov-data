<p><em>GoToWebinar voice:</em><br />The broadcast is now starting. All attendees are in listen-only mode.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Hi, everyone. We're really glad that you can make it here today for our webinar. Welcome to our technical training webinar series. This session will be on quality management systems for the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program, presented by Vladimir Kochkin with Home Innovation. Today's session is one in a continuing series of technical training webinars that we do to support our partners in designing and building Zero Energy Ready Homes. My name is Lindsay Parker. I'm the coordination support for the program, and I'll be covering some general housekeeping here at the beginning. All attendees are in listen-only mode, but we welcome you to ask questions throughout the webinar using the GoToWebinar questions application of the program. We will be monitoring these questions throughout the webinar, and if we find that some are particularly pertinent to the presentation at the moment, we'll manage them at the time. Otherwise, most questions will be dealt with at the end of the webinar. Additionally, this session is being recorded, and the recording will be posted on our Zero Energy Ready Home resources Web page after a couple of weeks. It takes some time to post it online and make sure that the transcript is available. But in the meantime, right after the webinar, we'll send you an email with the PDF of the presentation, so you can have that as a resource. So, right now I'm going to hand it over to one of our technical directors, Joe Nebbia with Newport Partners. He's going to talk a little bit about the program and introduce Vladimir.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Thanks, Lindsay. This is Joe Nebbia, support staff for the Department of Energy Zero Energy Ready Home program. And this program, we're extremely excited about. It's the Department of Energy's voluntary program for builders who are building the best, most innovative homes available on the market, and we're happy to have you here today.</p>
<p><em>First slide:</em><br />There are a number of items within this program that bring quality and quality management to a Zero Energy Ready Home, including a number of checklists that all homes must go through with the verification process that we think really increases the quality of a home. But in addition to that, we also encourage a set of quality management steps that we think are good ideas for all builders to do. They're not required in a formal way by the program, but builders can choose to adopt these steps. And without going into every detail, they involve project documentation, integrated design process, and the establishment of a formal quality management program. What we're going to talk about today is quality management systems and how they work with a Zero Energy Ready Home, and hopefully you'll get some ideas for maybe how you can approach quality management going forward. I'd like to welcome our guest speaker today, Mr. Vladimir Kochkin. As a director of applied engineering for Home Innovation Research Labs, Vladimir oversees engineering research programs on structural, environmental, and energy performance of residential construction, focused on systems performance, optimization, risk mitigation, and code compliance. Projects involve participation of multiple stakeholders including federal agencies, builders, product manufacturers, associations, compliance agencies, universities, and range from concept development and laboratory testing to field testing and monitoring. Kochkin has co-authored multiple research reports and guides for builders and product manufacturers and helped implement a product certification program based on quality management practices. He also works with product manufacturers on obtaining code acceptance for innovative construction technologies and approaches. He serves on several standard committees on several performance -- on structural performance of building systems. He also manages the (inaudible) process for the development for the National Green Building Standard.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And before I turn the presentation over to Vladimir, I just like to remind everyone, we are taking questions. Please submit them throughout the presentation, and we will try to get to all the questions that we can. You can type those into your webinar portal, and we will answer all that we can. So with that, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Vladimir.</p>
<p><em>Vladimir Kochkin:</em><br />Thank-you, Joe. Hello, everybody. So the title of this presentation is "Quality Management Tools for Zero Energy Homes," and the term that we'll use throughout the presentation is the QMS, which was the term acquired for quality management systems. There are two parts to the presentation. First, we'll talk about some basic principles of quality management systems. We'll provide everybody with some background, an overview of quality management systems that's been around for a while and will prove itself as a worthy tool for all businesses to use until there's been no exception. And after that, we'll talk about the application of quality management systems to Zero Energy Ready Homes. We'll specifically talk about the strategies and tools and resources that are available to builders to make that happen. A lot of this information I'll be presenting was developed through Building America program by several Building America teams, including us, Home Innovation Research Labs, as well as Building Science Corporation, IBACOS, and others.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The primary focus of the QMS and the strategies that we'll be talking about is to facilitate transition to Zero Energy Ready Homes, and it will -- these principles will work for all builders. Whether you right now are building a standard product, minimum-code house, and would like to switch your product line to Zero Energy Ready Homes, you'll find this useful, or if you are already building high-performance homes and just want to make a few improvements, a few tweaks, I think this information should be helpful to you, as well. The second goal is to, while you're going through this transition, you want to minimize the risks. And here we'll talk about your internal business risks that are internal for your company, as well as external risks, risks that come from the marketplace and the customers. Because they may be generated during the change that you're going through. And at the end of the day, we want to deliver on the Zero Energy Ready Home value proposition, and the quality management systems is really a key tool that can help you achieve that goal.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So if we talk about quality management systems, the primary goal of any quality management system is to deliver on the company's value proposition to its customers. And the term that we often use, quality management system, you can strike the word "quality" and replace it with "business." And all of the clients that I've worked with -- in fact, that's how they refer to their quality management systems and principles. They call them business management systems. And I think it's a good way of thinking about some of the information we're going to go over today. So what is the value proposition for Zero Energy Ready Homes? To me, it's a home that achieves two primary goals. It's a home that's efficient, but it's a home that also provides performance. Efficiency and performance, they're not the same. They're two different concepts that need to be looked at separately. Just to give you an example, if you add insulation to walls, you increase the R value. Now you've improved the efficiency of the home, but if you did not do it properly and you did not think through some of the details in the building science part of it, you can create a wall system that potentially, let's say, has moisture problems. And while your home is efficient, you don't really have the long-term performance of the wall that you need to have. Or another example, if you changed your HVAC system and your duct system to make it more energy efficient, but now your customers may not be comfortable because the design wasn't properly executed and implemented, again, you have the efficiency that you're looking for but you don't have the performance, and at the end of the day you're not going to have a satisfied customer. But what the Zero Energy Ready Home provides you, with solutions that do both. That help you as a builder to become more efficient, but also have a building that's a high-performance building. And if you achieve that, you're going to have a superior product. You're going to have a superior home. And you're going to have a satisfied customer. And that's the ultimate goal for any quality management system. ... The reason there's a delay -- I just apologize to everybody who are with us live, there I go ... So the official definition of Zero Energy Ready Homes for the program: It's a high-performance home, so energy efficient that all or most annual energy consumption can be offset by renewable energy. So as we are going through the presentation today, I want everybody to keep in mind this definition, because it's really key to everything we're talking about here.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what are the potential implications in business if you as a builder decided to build to Zero Energy Ready Homes? I think it's important to realize that at the end of the day, this is a different product. Don't think of these homes as homes that are kind of the same as what you were building before. Because it's a different product, you cannot any longer continue with your standard business-as-usual practices. I guess you maybe can, but you shouldn't. continue with the standard business-as-usual practices. Another way of looking at it also: What you don't want to do from the quality management standpoint is try to simply add another layer to what you are already doing. You really need to rethink some of the approaches, rethink some of the processes, and that's what we'll talk about here today. At the end of the day, you will have a house that needs to be designed and constructed to deliver on the value proposition and to avoid unintended consequences. And it's both unintended consequences during construction, as well as any potential unintended consequences that can happen after occupancy and certs. So this is the range of business level implications that you should keep in mind as you are making your transition.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now, switching back to quality management systems, what are attributes of a good functioning QMS? Your quality management system really has to be -- it should be -- part of your business model and it should be integrated into the routine practices. You don't want to have a quality management system that's introduced in a way that people do their 8-to-5 work, you know, job, and at the end of the day, sometimes they still need to squeeze in this QMS thing. That's not going to work. It really needs to be part of everyday business, everyday practices. Another attribute: A good QMS is not going to create self-serving requirements. Any step in your process and your requirement that the QMS introduces should have a clear eye to the value proposition for the customer. On the other hand, we don't need to reinvent the wheel, both from the business standpoint and from the product standpoint. The key really is to try to find a good match between tried and true practices with the Zero Energy Ready construction practices, as well as the business practices that your company uses. And at the end of the day, any good quality management system will again focus on the value proposition. And another recommendation is don't get caught in the QMS hype. There is a lot of different terminology and a lot of interesting information out there. The key is really to cut through a lot of that and focus on the basics, something that's really critical here to transition to Zero Energy Ready Homes, to high-performance homes, and those are the steps that we'll cover today.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So again, what is different? Why a Zero Energy Ready Home, why a high-performance home is different from a conventional home that builders have been building in the past. From the pure energy efficiency standpoint, some of the attributes that you will see, they're going to be different. You're going to have more insulation. You're going to have more effective insulation. You're going to increase the airtightness of your home. You're going to probably clearly delineate your control layers in your building enclosures, your air control layer, your water control layer, the thermal control layer. At the end of the day, you're going to end up with enclosures that are going to be less-permeable in addition to moreairtight. You're going to have an HVAC system that's going to be smaller, it's going to be more efficient. Same going to be for ducts. You may introduce some new technologies, such as passive solar, reflective barriers, PV systems, that were not part of the traditional house at all. So what are some of the implications as you're making this transition that you have to keep in mind? You have to worry about air quality. Think about ventilation. You've got to think about combustion safety. You've got to think about using the right equipment to make sure that combustion safety is not an issue. You may introduce moisture problems into the walls if you're not doing it correctly. Your details and specifications potentially are probably going to be more complex. You're going to use some new materials and new products that you haven't used in the past. Some of the systems may have a narrow margin of error. Not necessarily, some of the systems may be more resilient. Like, for example, if you do introduce (inaudible) on the exterior of the home, that wall system is going to be less prone to condensation in the wall cavity. So from that standpoint, you may more margin of error, but there may be some other considerations where it's not going to be the case. You'll need to pay attention to interactions between all of these different variables that I just talked about, and at the end of the day you'll need better coordination between all of the involved parties. So the result of all of this is that the house that you're building is a more complex system that requires comprehensive design and comprehensive construction solutions, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So let's talk about some QMS basics, and anybody who has been exposed to quality management systems in the past, they've seen this chart. And I don't want to go too much into it. It's based on ISO 9001 QMS requirements. That's a standard that's been around for a while, and although quality management principles have been around obviously for a long time, they evolve from being more of a quality control, where let's separate the product that doesn't meet our specs from the products that meet the spec, to evolving to a quality assurance program where people will try to take steps to make sure that they are making a compliant product, to quality management systems that are more directional in nature, where those systems are designed to achieve specific goals tied to value propositions for the company. So the ISO 9001 systems, it's a comprehensive system. And it's a universal system. It applies to any business. It covers the entire business. The one takeaway from this chart that you see here, the circle that's in the middle, that's the engine. That's the company that's making the product. It takes input from the marketplace, from its customers, from regulatory requirements, and it produces a product, which is the house, and tries to keep the customer happy. But the key to all of this is continual improvement, and I will talk about the concept of continual improvement multiple times in the presentation. But again, if you want just one takeaway from this entire graph, it's the continual improvement part that's really the engine for the entire quality management system.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what are some of the key elements of an ISO 9001-type quality management system? And again, I'm not going to spend all the time here. It takes multi-day training from ISO 9001 to go into all of it. But there are some of the key parts of that system it's important to cover. So you want to have a quality policy. And specifically, it's your company's value proposition to the marketplace. You want to set specific quality objectives for the year that's measurable. You want to deliver on those. You want to have a quality manual, and as I mentioned before, a lot of businesses, they don't call them a quality manual. They call them a business manual. Because it's really all about delivering, again, on the value proposition for your business. But having this document is very important. That's a reference of documenting the quality management system. Documenting its processes and the interactions between those processes. It doesn't have to be a long document, but it's a live document that's evolving with the QMS, and it's documented. It's important that it doesn't -- it exists on paper or in electronic format but it's not just something that people talk about through a company. It's something they can refer to.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another way of looking at the QMS and the parallels with the Zero Energy Ready Homes, you've probably seen this type of graphic before. It's a QMS pyramid, where at the top is the value proposition, then the goals, then the roles and responsibilities. And those are the who's doing, what are they doing, where are they doing it, and what are they doing. And the next one is instruction and practices. Those are the hows, and those are your drawings, the scopes of work, the specifications of the product. And at the bottom of the pyramid is the documentation. Those are the records that provide the proof that the QMS is actually working, but it also provides the data for the quality management system to be continually improved. It provides the information that a good quality management system needs to continue becoming better. And those are your checklists, your audit reports, your meeting minutes, maybe, and so on.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So just continuing with the QMS elements: You want to have a quality manager who is a representative from the top management of the company and a commitment from the top management is very important for a good quality management system. You want to have a management review. Again, it's about the leadership commitment, and those typically happen on an annual basis. And it's part of the business reviews that happen at the business level. A QMS needs to be audited to measure effectiveness of the QMS, to, again, enable continual improvement, and those audits can be internal. They can be third-party audits. Sometimes can be both. They don't have to happen very frequently. It can be also on an annual basis. But it's important that there is an audit, and one key requirement is typically the people that audit, they are all at work. They can be somebody from the same company, can be maybe the quality management that's doing your audit, but not auditing their own work. They're auditing other people's work.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />You need to provide resources for the QMS. Both human resources and the infrastructure are in place. You need to provide for the product realization, which is the design, the purchasing, the production. That's going to be the engine that provides the product. You need to document the QMS. You need to maintain control of all the documents, and the records have to be controlled as part of the quality manual and part of the QMS at large, overall. And they need to be reviewed for continual improvement, your design docs and the inspection docs, and so on. Customer satisfaction is a big key of a QMS system. You need to have a communication with your customers established, communication lines, so that you know that the customer's happy with the work they are buying from you. At the end of the day, again, it's continual improvement that's very, very important. And it's basically the information that's collected by the QMS and it's using the tools and the infrastructure that the QMS has to enable the continual improvement.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So at the end of the day, a QMS provides a framework for organizing just your commonsense business practices into a system that can be effectively managed and improved. So let's talk again about QMS in the Zero Energy homes. What the QMS will help you do, it will provide a framework for successful transition and successful implementation by providing tools for managing the change that you're going through, by providing tools to enable preventing any issues before they happen during the transition. It will provide infrastructure to obtain important feedback from your company, from the parts of your company and divisions of your company, as well as from the marketplace. It will allow you to very quickly detect and respond to any issues that they do happen, and it will help you to continually improve your business practices and your product offerings, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So, again, the QMS models and the ISO 9001 requirements, they've been developed for a very broad range of businesses. Often, larger-sized businesses with focus on control of manufacturing facilities. So as far as construction and building, there is really a need to streamline and customize for residential construction. And that's what, you know, the next few slides I will go through, is really that's the purpose of them just to apply the QMS principles to residential construction, to high- performance homes. So I will cover I believe eight strategies and tools that address that particular issue.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So the first strategy that we'll recommend for Zero Energy homes, is to develop a quality plan for transition. So again, if you're already building a high-performance home, and you want to make another step toward Zero Energy Ready Home, this can be useful to you, or if you're just right at this point building just standard homes and decided that you want to change your value proposition and start building Zero Energy Ready Homes, all of these tools will apply to you, as well. So from the quality plan standpoint, you want to perform a gap analysis and identify what are some key differences between the current specifications that you're using and the processes that you're applying. What the Zero Energy Ready Home specifications, and some of the processes that need to happen for you to achieve that level. You need to look at all of those differences and evaluate the impact of those changes. They also need to look at the interactions between the changes that you identify and then look at potential unintended consequences. Once you achieve that, the next step will be to prioritize and to align with specific quality objectives that's going to be part of your quality management system. And then develop actionable items and develop a follow-up process. So that's a framework for a quality plan that you want to develop during the transition period.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another strategy that we recommend is, high-performance homes and the building science becomes important. Design intent becomes very important. We recommend that you communicate the design intent throughout your company using the construction documents. So it's not just enough for me to specify what product you're using, I think it's helpful for everybody to understand what is the intent behind specifying the product? And having that intent being communicated throughout contract documents with architects and trades, throughout specifications, throughout drawings, the scopes of work, procurement documents and inspection forms.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />As an example I have here, let's say you obviously want to build a better home. Air barrier is a concept that is going to be important in achieving that. So clearly communicating what an air barrier is and what function it performs in a statement such as what you see in front of you, can achieve that goal in communicating the design intent. So for example, air barrier that's also air control / air boundary, is designed and installed to minimize the air flow between the conditioned space of the house and the outdoors. What it does, air barrier, it reduces thermal losses. It also reduces moisture wells in the wall, and it contributes to improved air quality and noise reduction. So now when people read the design intent, you understand why the changes are being made. They will also understand ramifications of any changes down the road that they may make during construction, during design phase, when they're working on home air barriers.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So just kind of continuing with air barrier. So let's say you are trying to hit ACH50 airtightness. You want to communicate a goal throughout your contract with the appropriate trades. You want to show the air barrier in drawings. And also include in the notes, you know, the design intent and how it works, as well. You want to show details, how it's accomplished. You want to potentially list specific materials and the specifications that are being used to achieve that air barrier function. You probably want to provide a specific installation sequence and details in the scopes of work on how this air barrier is done. You may have a list of very specific products that are approved to be using this air barrier for your homes. And also it's recommended you update your internal checklist to verify compliance when you're doing inspections, to the scope of work and the specific details. I do want to note that one of these resources also available is the Building America Solution Center that you can rely on to get some of this information.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So continuing with the example here, so what you see on this graphic is that the air barrier is clearly shown, the air boundary is shown, on this house. So the trades and the builder can clearly. know where the air barrier is. And the next step, we want to also identify where some of the detail drawings are needed to make sure that this air barrier is effective. Just again, to continue with the air barrier, you want to consider establishing as a quality objective, particularly if you're going from standard construction and want to get to a verified home, this is something you actually would monitor. You want to develop a quality control plan. You want to review and analyze data from testing. When the testing is being done, that's something you can analyze and see how effective the strategy is in providing the air barrier. Develop your follow-up actions. And include that in your annual audit and even potentially in the quality management review level, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The third strategy is to create correlation drawings. Again, you're going to be making different changes to the design, and what you want to do, you want to avoid conflicts between different systems. As you're changing one of the systems, it may impact other systems in the house. Or if you're changing multiple systems at the same time, again, it can lead to conflicts. What you want to do, want to avoid any unintended consequences from making these types of changes. So you know, some of the potential areas where correlation drawings can help have to do with cycling and orientation. Has to do with exterior drainage, to kind of show the sequence of how things need to happen. Framing and mechanicals, and HVAC distribution systems.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />As an example, here you see a drawing -- a correlation drawing -- showing your ductwork and the framing members. So now that you have high-performance ductwork, that potentially can be in the floor system because you're going to have your ducts in conditioned space, and it will clearly show how your ductwork is interacting with the structural framing members. And that's one we're showing.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another strategy, No. 4, is to conduct a correlation team member. So what you want to do, want to involve the parties that are impacted by the change that you're making. And want to get them on the same page early in the process. And while you want to include everybody who is going to be part of this change, on the other hand, you don't want to have the team too broad. You want to limit the team to those who are going to be directly impacted by the issues at hand. What it will help you with, it's going to achieve two primary goals. It's going to enable you to have an integrated design solution at the end. And also it will enable discovery of interactions and correlation issues before you actually get to the field.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And so I have a couple of examples here of people who you'd want to invite to a correlation team meeting, depending on what topic you are discussing. So let's say you decide to introduce advanced framing practices. So what you see on the left here is -- this is kind of the list of people you may want to consider inviting. It's not an exhaustive list by any stretch of imagination, but I think it's a pretty good comprehensive list that probably captures most of the people you want to have there. And it will depend on your business. It will depend on how you interact with trades and how you run your operation. But so the list of people that I've included here, you want to have an architect, because some of the advanced framing practices may impact where the windows are located. You're going to have a structural engineer, because again, with some advanced framing practices you want to make sure that you still comply with all of the safety requirements of the code. For example, if you want to go to 24 inches on center, you should know that you can only use 2 by 4s for one-story construction. You really need to switch your 2 by 6s if 24 inches on center, if you have a two-story house. You want to have your product supplier here, as well, just to make sure that the solutions you're coming up with, their products are actually intended for that application and can be used there. If you're panelizing the home, you want to have a panelizer as part of this conversation, as well, because obviously they're going to be framing those walls offsite. You're going to have the trades. They're going to be installing either framing or installing panels. Part of the conversation, as well. You may even want to consider adding other trades such as drywaller so that, again, we'll say you go 24 inches on center, so the drywaller or maybe plumber, they're familiar, they understand the implication of the change on them when they come back after the framers and the still-unfinished product. They know that the house is going to look different. You may want to have a site superintendent because he is going to be overseeing a lot of trades and will provide coordination down the road. You obviously have a builder representative. You want to have your purchasing people there in person, as well. Because they're going to be the ones that will tell you this is maybe too expensive; we don't want to buy this particular product. And you want to know that early on in the process. And having the third-party verifier or third- party rater I think also can be critical because those people often have a lot of knowledge and they have particularly broad knowledge and have building science knowledge they can bring to the table and help within that process. Now on the right-hand side, let's say now you're working on optimizing the HVAC system. That's a list of parties, again, you want to consider inviting. You want to have the architect, you want to have the equipment representative, HVAC contractor. You may want to have a framer there, as well. Say you're going to have ducts in conditioned space. You're going to go through the floor. The framers may want to be part of that conversation, as well. Third-party rater, may be nice to have, and some of the trades and the builders and similar people that we talked about. Also, you want to have code officials in mind. You may want to have your ducks in a row before you talk to a code official, where you have some design in place. But don't forget code officials because at the end of the day, they can be a showstopper. Make sure you get the buy- in from your building code department. Once you assemble this team, you want to probably keep it active until the change is implemented and verified. And once this transitional stage is complete and the change now that you've made becomes your new standard, notify the team and you can close it out and maybe move on to something else.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another strategy is a trade partner. And the key here is really to establish communication lines with your trades so that the trades can effectively support the builder goals. And the communication lines we're talking about here is going to be trade-to-builder communication, as well as a trade-to-trade communication, can be also just as important. And it's important to get the trades involved so that they understand the QMS, they understand how they contribute to the QMS, they really understand their role, because at the end of the day, they are the ones that are in the field, on the site, making these things happen. And so having them actively participating in your QMS is very important. You want to have them included in strategic planning. You want to have meetings with them. And definitely have them as part of the continual improvement system and the continual improvement cycle, because they will be able to provide input very early in the design phase, as well as they will be able to provide very quick feedback. And you want to establish a culture of dialogue and cooperation between, again, between the trades and the builder and the trades with other trades. Because again, that's where the interactions will happen when one trade leaves the site and the next trade comes in. And it's the interface where the potential problems can arise, and having those guys on the same page early, with the builder, with your quality system, with the quality objectives, and with each other, is important. So also, as you're switching to Zero Energy Ready Homes, you want to update from your basic documentations, specifications, your scopes of work, your checklists. That's your contract documents with architects, with engineers, with trades. Zero Energy Ready principles need to be communicated. You want to update your drawing, you want to revise your specifications, improve them. Your procurement document, your inspection forms will be revised, as well, because now you're going to have new systems in the house that you didn't have them before. You maybe even didn't have an inspection form or you didn't have a checkbox, some of those things, because they weren't part of the house before. But now they are. Those are the ones that are going to be more important to track, because those are the changes you make and changes you want to be tracking, changes you want to understand the implications to having. And so, throughout all these documents you want to provide sufficient amount of detail for successful implementation of these new practices without also overburdening the process, overburdening the designers and the trades. It's really a balance there that you need to strike. Just a few examples I will go through.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Let's say that you have a specification that tells you to have your air barrier aligned with insulation. Here's a detail that specifically shows you, if you have a recessed ceiling type situation, it shows you how -- it will tell you that you now take your job-ready checklist for your trades and your job-complete checklist, as well. Now if you go with 24 inches on center spacing, for example, don't just tell the framers they can just go do things at 24 inches on center. Create drawings. There are software packages available for that happening now, so it's not good a particular deal, but it can kind of show those framing members, show that new spacing, provide a level of detail that will help you in the long run. Again, if you're introducing some advanced framing practices, have those specific details as far as the construction documents, Don't just talk to the trades about it; have those drawings available so that they can implement them properly. And do it quickly, also. Don't get bogged down trying to figure it out on the site.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Another example showing how insulation and air sealing can be done, and the rim joist that can be part of the air-sealing strategy for the house. And it's going to be one of those details that I earlier talked about that you can provide. If you go into exterior insulation, and open exterior insulation foam, having all the details down properly, that opening is particularly -- so if you provide drawings and details showing how it's done in sequence, also you get into sequence such as drawing as this one, because its layering shows you different layers. You can understand the sequence of how those materials were installed. Again, all of these resources are either available on the Building America Solution Center or are going to be available on the Solution Center sometime soon.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And I have only a couple more things I will want to cover in the presentation. And one of them is the hotspot process. And that's the tool that was developed by the Home Innovation Research Labs and previously NAHB Research Center over the years as a tool to adapt some of the quality management principles to a construction business. And have it streamlined, have it as an independent, stand-alone management practice, and have it a self-contained process, with the goal of identifying, prioritizing, and greatly reducing the emerging or recurring issues. And so this tool has proven to be I think very effective. with some of the work that we have done with builder partners. It can be used, again, as a stand- alone tool. It can be used as a stepping stone to a bigger, broader quality management system, but this strategy can be very quickly implemented by any builder and can be very effective, again, at addressing your either emerging issues or recurring issues during the transition period that you may be going through. So what is a hotspot? When I say hotspot, what do I mean by that? First of all, it's an issue that has to be designated by the company management, based on an analysis of information. So it's done in a formal manner. It's not done off the cuff. It's something that's important. It's an issue that's been prioritized, and it's an issue that's been identified as important by the management. Typically, it's either a recurring problem or it's a potential problem. It can be a quality objective. It's something that if you are going through a transition, you know you're going to be making this change, you want to make a quality objective for yourself, you can manage this quality objective using a hotspot process, as well. It's maybe an issue that's limiting builders' effectiveness and efficiency. It doesn't have to be limited just to the actual bricks and sticks. it can be a process-oriented issue, as well. It's something that the company has to realize, if you designate something as a hotspot and you're going through a hotspot, process, it will require resources to resolve. You have to allocate those resources to make it happen.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So this is a diagram showing the hotpot process and how it works. And it's basically six simple steps. First you review the data that you have available to you at the management level. And the data can come from inspections, from testing, from warranty claims, from callbacks. There's a variety of sources, from analysis of information, from analysis of specification, if there's a new specification that you're trying to switch to. So you look at the data. You analyze the data. You identify what the problem is. You prioritize it. And by analysis, it's important to understand what the problem is. Like in any kind of a situation, if you understand what the problem really is, you're going to be halfway to getting it addressed. But the analysis is very important, again, to understand what is the problem and then prioritize those problems. And then you develop a solution based on the root cause analysis. Again, you want to understand what the root cause is, so you're solving an actual problem, not just trying to address the symptoms. Then you'll update your process and provide training for your trades, to the parties that are impacted by the hotspot. And once you have provided training, you want to implement now the solution in the field. After the implementation, you definitely want to monitor the effectiveness, and track the effectiveness. And while that information is collected, you want to close the loop and review the data again. So again, it's a six-step process: Review, analyze, prioritize solution, update the process, implement and support the implementation with the resources and the infrastructure, and then monitor and track and finalize.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what would not be a hotspot? If the issue has been resolved, it has to be taken off of the hotspot level. If it's an external issue that, it's maybe a big issue but it's not something that you're really in control of, the hotspot process is not going to work. There are other steps you need to take. If it's a minor issue, don't try to elevate it to a hotspot, because in the long run, it's just not going to work with the system. If it's something that may be important but it's localized and it's only limited to an individual or just one crew and doesn't have a broad impact, a hotspot is something that will actually have a company-wide implication. So you don't want to confuse the two. You still want to deal with this issue, but you don't want to elevate it to a hotspot level.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what are some of the hotspots that over time we've seen? Batt insulation installation quality, incorrect nailing patterns or having overdriven nails, flashing not installed properly, inspections not being done or not being documented, trades beginning work before the job-ready conditions have been met. Delays in the construction process, unexpected delays that lead to increased cycle time. You need to have trades return to a job site where it was not planned for. Maybe homes that don't consistently meet your airtightness requirements. You're getting customer callbacks on some issues such as air quality, for example. Your trades have constantly routinely failed inspections. Maybe the exhaust fan doesn't pass testing. The ERV/HRV are not balanced properly and so on. So those are just examples of hotspot.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So one of the steps is to, once you identify that you think there is an issue, you can prioritize. So how do you prioritize your hotspots? You take it down by frequency of occurrence of this issue. Maybe by cost. Maybe by length of the delays that you're having. The number of callbacks. The number of warranty claims that you have. Or the magnitude of the potential unintended consequence that can be generated by this issue that you've identified. The key is really to select a very limited number of high-priority items in order to maintain focus. The last thing you want to do is to call every single issue that you have as a hotspot and elevate it to that level. You really want to limit that list to just the most important items that you want to be affected.</p>
<p>You have to do the training right. Once you figure out what it is, you figure out a solution, have the training. This is just an example of a simple training technique for installing mechanical dampers. You have an image of how it is done right, and an image how -- what's the improper way of doing it. Again, simple and effective. You want to conduct a training session with the crew. Have a crew leader definitely attending to present some of this information. And then after the solution has been presented, training has been done, you definitely want to give everybody a chance to ask questions, talk through the issues. And make sure they fill out a form that they've attended this training. That's important both for accountability purposes and for record-keeping purposes, as well. And you need to track your hotspots. And there's just one example how tracking can happen where you're counting the recurring issues based on the different lots, and see you're basically tracking if it's happening or not. And then you can tally at the bottom. And it will give you an idea whether the solutions you've implemented and the training you put in place is working or not. So a couple of items here -- there are 3, 4, and 5 occurrences. You probably would want to say, you know what, you need to go back and rethink what we've done there. It's not really solving the issue everywhere. And you see some 0s and 1s that you probably are ready to demote some of these issues to not being a hotspot anymore.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So why does hotspot process works? Again, it provides a framework for prioritization. It enables a focused effort by clearly defining -- again, it's the definitions about what the problem is -- and partition of the issues from each other. It provides company-wide awareness on the issue. What it does is it allows you to modelize resources and to ensure accountability throughout the company, because now it's been elevated, people know that this is an issue, they know that the management is tracking it, and it will lead it to a definitive closure. You will know if it worked, if the process you've implemented works or it doesn't. And at the end of the day, what it does, it empowers your staff to the sense of a control because now they know that if they have a problem, they know how to deal with it. And when it's getting solved, they will have a sense of achievement that they really improved. Also, what it does: It helps you establish a culture of quality and it can be a first step toward establishing a company-wide quality management system, if you decide to go that route, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And the last topic I will quickly cover has to do with economics of quality. At the end of the day, all these different things that we talked about, they need to pencil out. And the way (inaudible) required on the quality management world is cost of quality concept, and there are four kind of sources of costs associated with quality. One is the cost of preventing problems from happening. Second is cost of quality assurance or, another term that is sometimes being used, quality appraisal. That's your cost of inspections, cost of audits, cost of quality control measures. And then cost of failure. And it can be an internal failure or external failure. So what you see, you know, you can group those into two categories. One is the up-front costs. In the first two, basically, that's the investment you're making in your quality. And the second group, that's really the consequences of the decisions that you've already made. And the goal here is really, you want to balance those costs, at the end of the day, to minimize the impact on the bottom line.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So some of you have probably seen this chart before, kind of showing you how this balancing act is happening. So what you see in the vertical axis here, the cost. And then on the X axis, let's say if you have all the products that you're getting here on the left are actually defective versus that on the right here, all the products that pass. And by the way, it's important to understand that there was never 100 percent compliance. That's the goal that we're trying to achieve. At the end of the day, there is always deviation. That's just the way statistics work. And so cost of prevention. The higher the level of compliance you want to achieve, the higher is going to be the cost of prevention. The cost of failure obviously will exponentially go up if you're manufacturing product that doesn't meet customer specifications. But there's a sweet spot, right? And that's the spot that you're looking for, is the sweet spot. And this will pilot the value proposition. And depending on where you want to be on this line, it's just your comfort level as a business, as a builder, or as a trade. And tie it to your value proposition for your customers, where you want to position yourself.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So a simple example here. On the left-hand side, those again, the same four categories of costs. So the example on the left showing that underinvestment in the prevention and the quality control that leads to significant costs on the internal failure and even more so an external failure, and showing you that if in fact you invest a little bit more up front trying to address these issues, you may eliminate a big, big chunk of them. So at the end of the day, at your bottom line you're going to be ahead. And that's the key here. So if you make an investment up front, but you're really going to save on the back-end through implementing the right quality management practices. Another diagram here that I think has been widely used, you must trade again the same concept of importance, of prevention and quality assurance, not necessarily speak for the numbers that you see here. But I think what it does, it really shows you the level of impact that is an order of magnitude difference at the different stages of the construction process. And if you address your issue at the design stage, it's going to be the smallest investment that you need to make, compared to if you are actually going to make a mistake and then you have to deal with either failures at the production level or even at the customer level. And just to summarize the presentation. Again, the quality management systems and tools and strategies that are available to you, they will enable your company to deliver on the Zero Energy Ready value proposition for your customers. It will help you to minimize the risks associated with this transition that you're going to be going through, or are going through right now. And also it will help you to maximize the bottom line, which is obviously very, very important.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So these are just the list of resources that are available to you on this topic, again, from the Building Science Corporation, from Home Innovation Research Labs now. We used to be NAHB Research Center. Those publications were produced before we changed our name. As well as resources from IBACOS. And some of them available on the Building America Solution Center, which has other resources on their website, as well, that's going to be helpful with the quality management systems and the transitions. This concludes my presentation. Thank-you very much.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Thanks, Vlad. We had a couple of questions that we have time for that came in toward the end. One, I think that you answered with your slide, but it was, are there example forms or example checklists for quality management systems that people could use? I know you mentioned the Building America Solution Center. There are a number of publications there at the end. Are there any other example forms you can point people to?</p>
<p><em>Vladimir Kochkin:</em><br />We, on our website at Home Innovation Research Labs, I think will have some information. There is another good source, that resource that's still available is ToolBase.org. Again, it's ToolBase.org. And there are quality management resources there, and there are definitely checklists that are available there, as well. ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup> program has its checklists. Zero Energy Ready Home has checklists, as well. So I think there is a wealth of resources available, but I think the Solution Center probably are going to be one of the best resources for that.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Alright, thanks. And the other question, I think I can answer. And that was, are there specific quality management requirements related to the Zero Energy Ready program and things that you have to do in order to certify a home? And the answer is, the quality management portions of the program that are required are things like the ENERGY STAR checklists, the other checklists in Zero Energy Ready Home that we require, like the solar-ready checklist, Indoor airPLUS checklist. These are all part of the program that you will go through and part of the verification process, that this home meets the program. And those are also good resources to look to, if you're looking for checklists that will help you achieve the type of performance that you're going to be aiming for in building a Zero Energy Ready Home. Beyond that, the quality management part of the program is recommended. And a lot of the things that Vlad has talked about today, we think are good practice for anyone to adopt. That's why we recommend them. And they'll also help you in trying to make sure you actually achieve the performance goals that you're going for. And that you're not failing inspection, the verification at the end of the process. So with that, that's all the questions we have time for. Thank-you for attending today. It was great to have you on. If you didn't get a question answered that you'd like to talk to us about, you can email us at <a href="mailto:zero@newportpartnersllc.com">zero@newportpartnersllc.com</a>. That's z-e-r-o, <a href="mailto:zero@newportpartnersllc.com">zero@newportpartnersllc.com</a>. And we will get back to you. Please visit our website, and check us out. We hope to be hearing from you soon and see Zero Energy Ready Homes coming from all of you soon.</p>
