<p><em>GoToWebinar voice:</em><br />The broadcast is now starting. All attendees are in listen-only mode.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />Hi, everyone. Welcome to the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home technical training webinar series. We're really excited that you can join us today for this session on sales and value recognition for Zero Energy Ready Homes, presented by Laura Stukel with Elevate Energy and Sandy Adomatis of Adomatis Appraisal Service. Today's session is one in a continuing series of technical training webinars to support our partners in designing and building Zero Energy Ready Homes. My name is Lindsay Parker. I'm the coordination support for the program, and I'll be covering some general notes on webinar housekeeping for the beginning. All attendees will be in listen-only mode, however, we invite you to ask questions throughout the session in the questions part of the GoToWebinar application. We'll be monitoring your questions throughout the webinar, and then near the end of the webinar, we'll get to as many questions of yours as possible. You'll be able to follow up with the presenters afterward if you have more questions that we didn't cover. This session is being recorded, and the recording will be placed on the Zero Energy Ready Home resources website, which I'll send the link out to, after the webinar. Please allow some time for the recording to be posted online, as it has to go through a transcription process, but after the webinar, we will be sending out a PDF of the presentation for your access, with also some information on the program. So that's housekeeping. Now I'm going to hand it over to Joe Nebbia with Newport Partners. He's technical staff here with the Zero Energy Ready Home program.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Thanks, Lindsay. I'd like to welcome everyone to the webinar today. I'm excited about today's topic.</p>
<p><em>First slide:</em><br />The Zero Energy Ready Home program at the Department of Energy, for those of you who don't know, is a program that encourages builders to build homes so efficient that a small renewable energy system could offset most or all of its energy use. But it's not just an energy-efficient home; it's also a durable, quality-built, comfortable, healthy home that includes advanced technologies. So these homes are homes of the future that are available today. And one thing that we hear over and over again from many of our builder partners is, if they're going to build a home that's this good, there needs to be a way to recognize the added value in this home. And it's an issue that the Zero Energy Ready Home program takes very seriously, and we're trying a lot of different things to try to facilitate this interaction between builders and lenders in the real estate transaction process. So one of the things we're doing is we just launched a new lender partner program, so lenders who want to participate in this program can sign up and be on our website. And these lenders are basically promising that, for a home that is Zero Energy Ready Home-certified, or ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup>-certified, or Passive House-certified, that they will use an appraiser that's listed on the Appraisal Institute's Valuation of Sustainable Buildings Professional Development program, and that they will also take into account the residential green and energy efficiency addendum that the Appraisal Institute has released. So the idea is that we can get lenders on board using a green appraiser and using the addendum to make sure that the proper value is assigned to these homes. And they get a nice list of homes that have a third-party certification. And we're really excited about this partnership. For any of you on the call who want to tell your bank, the bank that you work with, about it, we hope to have them signing up soon, so please get the word out. And the other thing that we're doing right now is holding this webinar, where we've got two of the best industry experts on this issue here to talk to you. So what we'd like to do to start out is to hold a small poll just to see who we have in the room before we go into our presentation.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:<br />First poll slide: </em><br />Alright. And now we're launching the poll. Poll is in progress. If you'll just take the time to vote, we're just looking to see how many people in the audience are builders, energy raters, designers, utility, or other. Alright, about 78 percent of you have voted. Alright, great. We're going to go ahead and close the poll now. Thank-you so much for those of you who participated. And I'm going to show ...</p>
<p><em>Poll results slide:</em><br />Here we go. Now you'll see that 57 percent are other, 18 percent are builders, 10 percent energy raters, and 11 designer.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />OK, thanks, Lindsay. So getting on to our presentations, if you have questions throughout, all users are on mute. We have quite a big crowd. But if you have -- if you have questions, please submit them and we will get to as many of them as we can at the end. There's a questions feature in the webinar, and you can type in questions to us and I'll be organizing them throughout the talk.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So now I'd like to introduce our first speaker, who I'm especially excited about. Laura Stukel serves a number of roles in the industry. Her assignments include the National Association of Realtors, Real Property Valuation Committee, and the Green Resource Advisory Board. She manages the national Value for High Performance Homes Campaign, via Elevate Energy in Chicago, and she's a recipient of green advocacy awards from both EcoBroker and the National Association of Realtors. Laura has been directly involved in building the infrastructure that connects the energy efficiency industry to real estate transactions, including visible value blueprints for efficiency programs and the Green MLS Implementation Guide for MLS operators. So we've got a really great expert here today, and I'm excited to hear what she has to say.</p>
<p><em>Laura Reedy Stukel:</em><br />Great; thank-you, Joe and Lindsay. And I'm very excited to be here for the Zero Energy Ready Home webinar. As Joe mentioned, I manage the Value for High Performance Homes Campaign. So that's a national steering committee and also a series of deliverables that we are identifying that are needed to bridge the transaction from the builder to the real estate market, which includes Realtors like myself and appraisers like Sandy Adomatis, who is going to speak after me. So, thrilled for the opportunity here, and I think the other tie-in and something I hope you'll take away from today, is that a lot of what I'm going to say is about the power of a third-party vertification and the power of a really strong brand. So it's really fun to be here today, and I think the Zero Energy Ready Home is an example of a program that is tying everything together.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So, just a quick overview of the Value for High Performance Homes Campaign. Our mission is that we can create a virtuous cycle where homeowners are rewarded for their investment in high performance. And I know that's something that everybody on this call is interested in and that it's not just so much homeowners and builders pursuing this work but it's that cycle where additional homeowners look to what their neighbors have done, to the product that the builder is putting on the street, and the expectations that they can and do deserve a better product, and so that others are motivated to invest in high performance, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So one of the things that we found in our work is that this is not something that is a fix in just one industry. And so that's a really -- another reason that it's so great to be a part of this call today. It's sponsored by a building program. I'm a Realtor; Sandy's an appraiser. But that's what we've really found, is that early on in this conversation people were really gravitating toward what's happening with the appraisal, what's happening with the MLS. And what I'm going to talk about today is about the whole ecosystem, which starts with the designers, with the builders, and then gets passed down the chain to all these key stakeholders like the lenders that Joe also mentioned. So the good news is if you look at the end of this graphic, what we found time and time again, is that all the stakeholders involved at every step in the process, from 1 to 5, everybody's got the same outcome in mind, which is fair value at closing for high-performance homes. But some of the hangups have been that we've jumped into different parts of the stakeholder process without looking at how all the pieces fit together. So that's what I'm going to talk about a little bit today, and then set it up for Sandy to talk specifically about the needs of the appraisers. And then just a note there: We can pass the links along, and we'll make a copy of the presentation available. But this graphic comes from a collaborative effort called GreentheMLS.org, and there is some information there on how the pieces fit together, and then also specifically around that step No. 2, about the green MLS and how listing agents and buyers' agents fit into the transaction.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So let me talk for just a minute about the Realtor's perspective and the National Association of Realtors. What I have up here on this slide is a copy of their policy on the energy efficiency issue. And I've highlighted a couple things there, because there's some pretty strong language in this policy, and I think in the work that I've found, I think all of the stakeholders really focus on the things that NAR is saying not to do. So it's very clear that NAR encourages anything that's voluntary. And that anything that's required at the time of sale is in opposition to their approach for how do we do energy efficiency. So we spent a lot of time really focusing on the what not to do.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />What the Value for High Performance Homes Campaign is all about is taking some time to step back and say, look, there are some positive things. It's very clear in their policy that they are also -- there are some very specific things that they do encourage, and that Realtors encourage, and that makes the whole process work more smoothly. So that's really what my work has been. What can we do around the voluntary incentives, commercially reasonable approaches, and education? And I think that DOE Zero Energy Ready Home is something that fits right into this voluntary incentive, commercially reasonable approaches. So let me walk everyone through how the pieces fit together.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So Joe had mentioned that one of the deliverables we worked on as a part of this campaign is called "Unlocking the Value of an Energy Efficient Home." And that is something that Elevate Energy co-wrote with the National Home Performance Council. And since that time, in last August, we've both gone through a name change, so CNT Energy is now Elevate Energy, and National Home Performance Council is now part of the Home Performance Coalition. But we will make a copy of this document available. And the important thing about this document is that, like I said, we've been doing lots of work on the stakeholders, we've been identifying the opportunities to work together, and we've been identifying where some of the barriers are. So this blueprint -- the nickname is the Visible Value Blueprint -- this blueprint is specifically written just for builders, remodelers, energy efficiency programs, utility program managers, but it's really the secrets that are within your sphere of influence for how to work with the real estate industry. So we saw that there was a lot of discussion about wanting to do that, but not necessarily best practices and some opportunity assessment about how to actually get the transaction flowing better, and what specifically could be addressed by builders, remodelers, home performance contractors, utility programs, that side of the stakeholder spectrum. So there are seven steps outlined in the blueprint. There's three of them that are in bold that I'm going to talk about today. And then, luckily Sandy is here to talk about the appraiser design valuation studies. But kind of going back to my point about the importance of third-party verification and a strong brand. So the three that I'm going to talk about today are documenting high-performance home upgrades, so any time you're above code, how do you document that for the real estate market? How do you disclose inventories, what is the count of those properties, where are they? And then how that feeds specifically into the green multiple listing service, which obviously is the database that real estate agents, whether they're listing a property or working with the buyer, use to market and identify properties. And then as I said, we're going to skip continuing education, which is step No. 3, Sandy is going to cover step No. 5, which is related to the appraiser needs, and then I'm going to tease a little bit about, if we get these things right, what are some of the really cool opportunities that open up for us down the line?</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So with that, I will transition to the rest of my content here, which is labeled affectionately, if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? So again, this is back to this idea of the importance of third-party verification and a really strong brand. So keep this image in mind, because it really relates to some of the disconnects that we've seen in the real estate market today.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So step 1, as I said, in the Visible Value Blueprint is about documenting upgrades. So that's that tree falling in a forest and no one's there to make it hear a sound. So if the real estate industry doesn't have some kind of consistent set of paperwork, some kind of paper trail to follow to say this home is different, this is a Zero Energy Ready Home, the heating and cooling requirements are significantly different, the quality of the home is different, there's got to be some kind of trigger, some piece of paper that says to the market this home is different from a code-built home. So if that step is not happening on the builder, the remodeler, the construction folks, whatever it is, then the rest of the process cannot happen. So what you see there is a great picture; it comes from a YouTube video that's related to the Georgia energy efficiency code. And what you see in there is a sticker that's required in the utility box to state specifically, this home has met that 2012 code. And the interesting thing about the sticker, and the reason that I love this image, is because people don't know this but a lot of Realtors and appraisers were trained to look for an ENERGY STAR sticker in the utility box or some kind of notation that, there was some early-on training that said that that's how you can tell that these homes have specifically participated in ENERGY STAR. And in just talking to Realtors in the field and appraisers as well, that doesn't happen. But it's kind of funny, because we're sort of trained to look for that, but yet the stickers don't exist. So a lot of what I'm going to cover is very simple. But this is a huge step, just to have a consistent piece of paper or a sticker or whatever it is, so that the professionals in your market know, if they're going to manage this product differently because it was built differently, they know where to get the documentation that they need to have the whole rest of the process fit together. So that's a great example from Georgia there about what we mean about documenting upgrades.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, so the second step is about disclosing inventories. And one of the things that the real estate market has been really challenged about is that for example, ENERGY STAR has a great set of data that's available on their website that says how many ENERGY STAR homes have been built in different markets. USGBC has GBig, and you can find out how many LEED for Homes products have been given in a certain market. But what the problem is for the real estate market, is that we don't have access to the whole picture. So we get this information about the pieces and the parts, but we don't know how that relates to the overall housing inventory. So what you see on slide 9 is a prototype map that looks at the count of all homes since 2000, which were built in the top 100 U.S. metro statistical areas, and they were built to a third-party certification that included the National Association of Home Builders, National Green Building Standard, USGBC's LEED for Homes, and ENERGY STAR, So in this case it doesn't include Challenge Home or Zero Energy Ready Home, but the context that this map provides is that then we've analyzed that information against all the homes that were built in these particular markets since 2000. So the colors start to tell you where the deepest penetration of high-performance home building is happening in different markets around the country. And actually, I should specify: This is actually the percentage of homes that are eligible to be entered into the standard field for green MLS or their listing of high-performance homes in the multiple listing service. And interestingly enough, in most of the cases these markets also are an MLS market area. So now all of a sudden we have this data that becomes information for the real estate market. So we can tell these MLS markets, and if you look at Houston down in Texas compared to Chicago, where I'm from, which is orange and a lower density, but in Texas, in Houston, we can start to have the conversation that says, hey, you've got a 1 in 5 chance, a 1 in 3 chance, that your home is going to be eligible for listing in the multiple listing service. And so it causes the real estate agents to think about what the product is, about if their product is matching up to the competition, how they market these homes. It creates a business case for them to pursue training differently. So just this idea of thinking about the whole inventory and presenting that back to the real estate market, we found is an extremely effective way to engage the real estate market.</p>
<p>And one other thing I'll call to your attention on this slide, and hope that this sort of resonates with you: You see that term on the top, "Inventory Scientists." And I use that as a way to really put in perspective -- I think there's some misconceptions about particularly real estate agents. I think a lot of times people envision us as baking cookies and hosting an open house and being this host at an open house. And the reality is, the way that we get paid is based on looking backwards in the inventory and coming up with recommendations. "Your neighbors did X, and their house sold in 30 days, so you need to do X." "Four homes like yours sold in the past 90 days, so this is a market range that we can use to promote your home." And I know Sandy will talk about the appraisers, but they're very much paid to do the same thing. So where we have building scientists in construction, you have to remember that we have inventory scientists in real estate. So unless you're prepared to share the data and be part of the process to make sure that in your market that the professionals really understand the trends and the inventory, you're just not going to find the kind of engagement and support for improving the transaction that we're all trying to work toward. So in closing, I will say that this is a prototype map. It includes just the three big programs that I mentioned. We do know that there are double countings, because we're looking for eligibility of field, so there is some overlap of the counting. So these percentages might be higher than the actual number of homes in these markets. But I hope that it gives you a takeaway to think, what's the neighborhood that I sell in? How can I work with other builders in my market so that we can start reporting the whole piece of the pie in a meaningful way to these inventory scientists, so that we can engage them in understanding how the product is shifting? And in particular with those of you that are dealing with Zero Energy Ready Homes, it's not that the product is just shifting but it's getting so much better in terms of the performance of these homes and the quality of these homes.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So with that, I want to do a quick poll. And I will turn things over to Lindsay to do this. And I'll go ahead and read the wording while we're getting the poll up. But the question is, do you work in a market where Realtors and appraisers have access to green MLS fields? So the previous map showed the inventory, and now what we want to get a handle on is how many of you work in areas where there's actually a place where real estate agents can market these homes using a field in the MLS, and then appraisers and buyers' agents can search to find them.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:<br />Next poll slide:</em><br />Alright. Thanks, Laura. The poll is in progress, so thank- you to those who are participating. We'll leave it up for a couple more seconds.</p>
<p><em>Poll results slide:</em><br />Alright. I'm going to go ahead and close the poll. The results are pretty ... 44 percent said yes, 11 percent said no, and 45 percent said unsure.</p>
<p><em>Laura Reedy Stukel:</em><br />OK. So that's interesting. Yea, let's go. I actually have some data on this. But it's interesting what the spread was.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And for the nos, that's actually fairly accurate for what we found around the country. But here's another map. This is based on some preliminary information that -- NAR did a survey a number of years ago, and then Elevate Energy did some follow-up, again in these top 100 population areas. And in about 90 percent of the cases these metropolitan statistical areas are also the same coverage area of the MLS. So it's kind of interesting, because you have this nice setup between a standard way to look at a metro area and then these MLS entities. A couple of notes: The areas like Atlanta, L.A., San Francisco, and New York are the notable ones where there's actually double coverage. The MLSes overlap or there are a few smaller ones that cover the metro area. But for the most part, among the biggest metro areas, they have one MLS that covers that whole area. The other thing that's kind of interesting is that there are about 800 MLSes nationally, and they drop off in size pretty rapidly. So we found it easier -- I apologize if not everybody's MLS or metro area is up there -- but we found that because these are also the biggest MLSes, that that's kind of the most manageable way to start to get a handle on green MLS implementation. So what's interesting there is the green areas are obviously the ones that do have access. Some type of green MLS field is available in these markets. And the red ones are the ones that are not available. And then we just have Little Rock there, where we haven't been able to track down a response. So we found nationally it's about 15 percent out of this top 100 that do not have access to green MLS fields. In some cases they are working on it. So hopefully that's an area that we can see some change. But for the most part, there's good news across the country. So if you're in these big markets, it's probably just that you're not aware of it. And it could be possible that the Realtors that you're working with may not be aware of these fields, as well. But it is encouragement. If you are among the 45 percent that said you weren't sure, it's a good idea to go back and do your homework. Figure out who the MLS is and get some insight into what kind of fields they have available. One thing, it's a little hard to tell with the double-click that I'm doing here, but again, inventory scientists is a real estate market response to what's in the inventory. So what's interesting about these two maps is where you see yellow, green, on the inventory map, it's also pretty much correlated to where you see green on this map here. There's only a couple of areas that we found where there's a higher percentage of high- performance home building going on, and the MLS hasn't caught up to that. So that's another piece of good news, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So, as I wrap up here, again, back to this idea of documentation and the power of third-party and a good brand. What I want to show here is that the real estate industry is rallying around a standard set of fields for high-performance homes. And so what's really interesting is that you have a set of third-party verification fields, and then some of the technical details. But what's fascinating, when you look at the third-party verified fields, the MLS industry -- this is so important, the third-party verifications, it's so important. They don't just have one field about this. They don't just have two fields about it. They actually have six different ways to capture the richness and the high-level detail about these verifications. So in the example of Zero Energy Ready Homes, you see that of the fields that are standard for the MLSes to adopt, there's three of them that could be populated. So the program is Zero Energy Ready Homes, the green verification body is DOE, and perhaps it was verified in 2014. So there's a consistent way, if you're giving us the paperwork up-front, there's a consistent way now. And we know that it's available in 85 percent of the market. There's a consistent way to be able to present that information in the MLS. So that's very exciting progress and again, this is the whole takeaway that I hope you have today, is the power of the verification -- they're asking for it six different ways because it's so important -- and then a brand that stands out in a consistent way, like the Zero Energy Ready Home program does.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then the last thing I'll just tease out, is that one of the reasons that we want to standardize data, that we want to have strong brands, that we want to have a really consistent way to document homes, is that there could be a future where we take that inventory that I showed in that first map, and we could actually send it to the MLS operators. So we might not have to rely on a listing agent having to know that that information's there. When we start to see the verification fields at the scale that we're seeing, so that the map that I show with the inventory, that represents 2.5 million records on homes. And so just like today, MLSes will receive information about the square footage of a home, the tax rate, the year of the tax assessment, that is all being auto-populated today to agents so that they don't have to manually enter that data. And so the consistency that we're talking about today, if we get really rigorous about making that information available consistently, we set up an opportunity where, if that information is all going to a listing agent, it's going out to all these different brokerages, and it really would change how homes are -- first of all, consumers' expectations for these homes, and then how they're marketed and sold.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then the last thing is a quick sample here from where this is actually happening in the Chicago MLS. Today you can automatically -- a listing agent can go in and automatically pull the annual and monthly electric and gas cost amounts for a property when it's listed for sale in Chicago. So this is related to an ordinance that the City of Chicago requires. And because there's a consistent way to pull this information through an application called MyHomeEQ, this is actually happening in Chicago, and it creates a great precedent for the kind of data sharing and automation that we really can create.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So in closing, I would encourage you all to really, you know, if you're building homes to these standards, please make sure that the tree does not fall in the woods and nobody hears it. Whether it's a sticker or a piece of paper that you're sharing with your buyers, make sure that we know that those homes are being built and that they're different. Help us count, so we know how the trends are changing in the inventory. And then make sure you hold your real estate agents accountable to use the fields that are available to them. We'll make the links available and a copy of this presentation. And my information is there for Q&amp;A afterward. And with that, I'll throw it to Joe to kick things over to Sandy.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Thanks, Laura. That was great. Really, really good stuff. Like Laura said, this presentation will be available in probably a few different forms. But the Department of Energy does post all of these webinars on our website so you can go back and review them later. So now I'd like to introduce our next speaker, who I'm equally as excited about.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />I got to hear Sandy Adomatis speak at the EEBA conference a few months ago, and it was an eye-opening talk on the appraisal process. And I can say that I don't think there's another person who's more of an expert on green appraisals out there. Sandy is an active real estate appraiser and instructor, author, and appraisal course developer. She received her appraisal designation from the Appraisal Institute in 1985 and immediately became active in the Appraisal Institute.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Sandra authored the "Residential Green Valuation Tools," published April 2014 by the Appraisal Institute. She owns Adomatis Appraisal Service in Punta Gorda, Florida. She provides appraisal services including residential, multi- family, condominiums, vacant land, and small commercial uses, in Charlotte County, Florida. Through Advanced Energy of Raleigh, North Carolina, and General Electric Appliance and Lighting Division, she uses her appraisal skills to serve as a consultant in the area of valuation of energy efficiency and green building technologies. Those consulting skills also serve a number of builders needing assistance in understanding the appraisal process. So I'd like to welcome Sandy Adomatis, and I am excited to see her presentation.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />Alright. Thank-you, Joe. And thank-you, Laura, for a nice setup for my part of this presentation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And I'd like to thank everyone for taking their time to listen to us today. And hopefully it will provide you with some tools that you can implement and make the closing of your high-performance homes go much smoother. With my talk today, my portion of it, it will be a carryover from what Laura has already given us from the Realtor side of things, and the inventory side, which is so critical to moving into the appraisal process side and getting a fair value for your home. All the information she gave you, it links right over to the appraisal process.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I'm going to start first by talking about the different labels that are out there. We have a lot of people using labels or names for houses, and they really aren't talking about the same house. Our definitions -- we assume everybody has the same definition we do. And in the courses that I teach at the Appraisal Institute, I make it very clear to the appraisers, when a Realtor or a builder tells you they're building a house and they give it a name, ask them how they define that house. What do they mean by a green house or a high-performance house? A Zero Energy Ready Home? So ask them that question up-front, and I would encourage everybody on the webinar today that you do the same, so that we're sure we're talking the same language. So in the courses I teach, when we talk about a green house, we're talking about a house that's energy-efficient, resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, and then has characteristics in all the six elements of green building here, that are listed on this slide. When we talk about high-performance house, it may have all those items, as well, and it may not. That's why the documentation comes in very important, to know really what is the appraiser measuring here? What type of house? What label are we giving it? And then we go to the code-built house. And we have many different areas that are using different codes. So again, a code-built house may even have many of these features, as well. And without that documentation, an appraiser is left to making some assumptions that may not be correct. And then today we have -- we're going to be talking more about the Zero Energy Ready Home, and this home is energy-efficient. They use a low-lying fruit by building that tight envelope. It may be resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, and it may have all those six elements of green building. But again, we need the documentation, as an appraiser and as a real estate agent that's trying to sell this home, we need the documentation to be sure that we're talking about the same type of property.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Documentation for the appraiser and for the lender. Key here is the Appraisal Institute's Residential Green Energy Efficient Addendum. Now this is accessible through the Appraisal Institute's website, and the link is below here. They have it in a PDF format. You can download it at no cost to you, and auto-populate it using Adobe. And it's written for appraisers, builders, real estate agents, energy raters, and homeowners or sellers of a property. The person with the most information should be the one to fill it out. In many cases, that's the builders themselves. Other cases, if you have an energy rater, they will have all that information required in the energy addendum to populate that. And so the person with the most information should fill it out. Here's the key. Here's how this works. So important for you builders. You need to really listen to this. If you have this filled out and filled out accurately, and you pass it along to your borrower when they go to the bank to apply for a mortgage, insist that the borrower give this to the loan officer. And along with this document, they tell the loan officer, this is a special type property. It's not your normal code-built home. So it's going to require a competent appraiser that has knowledge of this addendum. So that's the key to the lender that, whoops, I need to follow the secondary mortgage market guidelines and hire a competent appraiser. So that's the key right there, is being sure you get the competent appraiser that's aware of this addendum. So then the lender needs to send it on, if they use an appraisal management company, they need to send it on to the appraisal management company. So that's a key to the person ordering the appraisal that I need to find an appraiser who has knowledge of this document. Now whether the stories that we've heard about the addendum -- the borrower went to the bank with this addendum completed, gave it to the lender, lender sent it to the AMC. The AMC sent this to the appraiser, the next one on the rotation list. You know how that works. And when that appraiser received it, I give them a lot of accolades, because the appraiser said, called up the AMC, sent it back and said, I can't do this appraiser because I don't know anything about this property type. Now that's a professional appraiser that knows their limits. So that's how this document can work for you.</p>
<p>Along with that being the first notification the lender has that this requires a special appraiser, it also gives the appraiser the information they need to realize that I need to find comparable sales, sales that actually would compete with the same buyer and that have the same or similar features. If they don't have this information, they may pull sales that they think are comparable because they don't know the details of the home, when in actuality they are not comparable. So that's where the documentation that Laura was talking about, through the MLS, documentations through using this addendum. Give it to the Realtor if you have a real estate who lists in the MLS. Ask them to upload it as an attachment in the MLS. Again, that gives the buyers that are looking at it, can look at this addendum and see all the special features. The appraiser can look at it. We're using this as a comparable sale. We can look at this addendum and match it up with the house we're appraising to say this is comparable. And you'll have a more accurate appraised value by using this. This is not a form that's required by Fannie, Freddie, FHA, or VA. However, they do say -- those in the secondary mortgage market -- it is up to the appraiser what documents they need to attach to the 1004 form. So an appraiser is free to use it. And again, this is something I really encourage you to do. And remember that you do have what I call the consumer's bill of rights. The secondary mortgage market -- Fannie, Freddie, and FHA, all three of those -- do say that they require a competent appraiser prior to accepting the assignment. VA does not have that policy, but the other three do. So that means you have the right to require a competent one. That means somebody who's had the education. That's why DOE is promoting the Green Registry. Because the appraisers on the Green Registry through the Appraisal Institute have taken three courses and three exams. So these aren't just three-hour deals. We're talking about the appraisers taking four full days and three exams to get on that registry. So they have a knowledge of this addendum and the features of the home that you're building.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now this next slide here talks about the RESNET / HERS Index registry. The registry has been opened up recently, and I really praise RESNET for doing this. Prior to this year, no one had access to this HERS Index registry other than the HERS raters. Now, anyone can go into this database here and plug in an address. A Realtor can do it. The appraiser can do it. We can do it on our comparable sales. For homes rated 2012 and forward, they will be in this registry. We can pull it up by address and find out what the HERS rating is and who did the rating, the year it was rated. Get information for us. And again, that follows Laura's documentation. This gives us access to that. More and more, we need these private databases to be opened up, if you really want fair value for these homes. So the appraiser can go into the MLS, If the HERS rating is not in there, or if we question the ratings they give, we can go to the database here and pull it up. So that's a real plus going forward. At this point, I'd like to ask Joe if he could pull up the poll of how often do the builders get HERS Index ratings on their homes. If we could pull that up, I'd like to run that right now, since we're talking about the HERS RESNET rating.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:<br />Next poll slide:</em><br />Alright, Sandy. The poll is in progress.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />OK, good. I spoke to a builder group in Las Vegas last week, and the group I was speaking with all said they built high-performance homes, but when I asked the question, I only had one that even had HERS Index reports on their homes. So, not sure how they're getting across to the real estate agents or the appraisers the knowledge or documentation, if they're not doing HERS reports. And it's a really important document for us, to have available to us. And keep in mind, this HERS report, when you -- put it along with that AI addendum, put the full report -- not just the first page that shows the numbers -- put the full report in there. And as I move to my slides, you'll see why it's important.</p>
<p><em>Lindsay Parker:</em><br />OK. So the poll is in progress. Thank-you to those who are participating. I'm going to go ahead and close the poll now and show everyone the results of what we have.</p>
<p><em>Poll results slide:</em><br />So for how often do you have HERS reports on homes that you're building, 22 percent said never, 30 percent said sometimes, minority of the lowest have them half of time. And 28 percent said always.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />Good. So 28 percent, that's pretty good. And I think that will increase as we move forward.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So let's talk about appraiser's resources for valuing your high-performance home. Appraisers can use the cost analysis. We can look at your premiums. That's why it's important to always provide the appraiser with what was the cost over the code, the current code in your market. What was the cost over that code to build this home to a Zero Energy Ready Home, or a high-performance home? Whatever you're building. Give us the cost premium over code, because that's one figure that appraisers can use as a test of reasonableness to make adjustments in our sales comparison approach. We also have the ability to use the income approach to prove an adjustment for your energy efficiency or for the label itself. We can use a discounted cash flow, or we can use the present value of the energy saved. The PV Value Tool offers a free Web-based tool that I'm going to show you a little later, for the solar PV. It comes in really, really handy for that. On the energy efficiency side, the appraisers can look at that full HERS report. In the HERS report, it will show us the energy savings. So we can calculate that and bring it into present value calculation for the energy efficiency adjustment. And the technique that the underwriters dream about at night is the paired sales data. That's all we hear about. Well, if you don't have a paired sales, then you can't make that adjustment. Well, that's really not what their guidelines say. And I'll show you an example of a paired sale a little later on here. And then we'll talk about appraiser studies. Laura introduced the appraiser-driven studies, and that is discussed in "Unlocking the Value of Your High Performance Home," as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So here is the PV Value Tool. If you're building an energy-ready home, to get it to a net zero energy, to produce as much energy as it uses, one option is throwing on a solar system, a solar photovoltaic system. And this great tool was financed through a grant through the Department of Energy. And Energy Sense financed, and Sandia Labs collaborated together to develop this tool. It's free for anyone. Builders, appraisers, real estate agents, homeowners, all of those folks are using this tool. We kept trying to -- what part of the industry is using this. What it does is, if you fill out the AI Green Addendum, the solar page on there, all the inputs there will translate over into -- we can take those inputs and put them into the PV Value Tool. You can do it on your iPhone, you can do it on your iPad, or on your computer. In less than five minutes, I can have a value of that solar PV system using the income approach. This is the discounted value of the energy produced. So it's very important, again, it plays into the AI Green Addendum, why it's important to get that filled out. You can get a more fair value for the solar PV system. This is a page here showing the final page of the document. So there are several pages that the appraiser or whoever's doing the input would fill in. And at the end, it would give us three values: a low value, high value, and the average value, based on the discount rates that we're applying.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And here is an appraiser testimony of how this PV value is being used. You can see here -- I received this recently. I taught a class in Tempe, Arizona, in November. And the class was sponsored by several folks in the Arizona area, including three AMCs, appraisal management companies. And after the class, this was like within a week after the class, this came in from one of the appraisal management companies. It says, we officially performed our first solar appraisal on behalf of a lender. One of the panel appraisers -- this is the AMC panel appraisers -- that was in Sandy's solar class had the pleasure. He did a great job, and there was value-given, with correct methodology for the home's solar PV system using the PV Value Tool. The lender was so excited and would like to learn more. How can we promote this tool further? So again, that's one lender that came back right away, after the PV Value Tool was used to value the solar system, saying, we really like this tool. So it is accepted in the market. We have more testimonies than that.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Let me give you from my own market area what's happening with net zero energy homes. Now here we're referring to it as net zero energy, but it would be the same type of house as when we talk about Zero Energy Ready Homes that DOE is promoting. This particular builder is in the Tampa area, Marc Rutenberg Homes. 44 percent of their sales in this particular neighborhood are net zero energy homes. 60 percent of the remaining homes in that subdivision are at a minimum green-certified homes in the Florida Green Building Coalition. So again, when we go into that market, if that particular neighborhood is all net zero energy homes, or all green homes, the appraiser right then knows, we should have some comparable sales in that given market. And what was interesting when I asked for buyer profile, that these are the terms that they gave me. They said most of their buyers are downsizing. They're empty-nesters, and they're typically between the age of 55 to 72. Now, you probably wouldn't find that unusual for Florida, because that is where people of this age come to, to retire. It's in Florida. Most of our professional people, they're very knowledgeable about zero energy. And they're research- oriented. So these are people that know what they're buying. They're particularly looking for this type of house. So again, your marketing really needs to advertize zero energy ready or zero energy home or high-performance home. Most of the listings I've seen from the builders, they're "three bedrooms, two baths, three-car garage." They don't mention it's a HERS Index of 22, or HERS Index of 0, or net zero energy ready. Make that part of your advertising, so appraisers and Realtors can pick up on that, so your buyers can pick up on it. And I ask, well, are you doing any tracking? And I would highly encourage any builder on the phone to track your homes, to see if the energy use is similar to what you estimated it to be on the plans and specs. Three net zero energy homes have been occupied for six months to two years, are showing a zero energy bill. So the tracking is really important. It's important to get that information out to Realtors, appraisers, and the public.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Net zero energy home development success story. I asked them, are they having any problems in this particular market in Tampa in getting their appraisals? And they said absolutely not. They found a lender, No. 1, that would work with a competent appraiser. That was an appraiser from the NEI Green Registry. So it's an appraiser that had taken our courses through NAI and taken the exams. The builder always completes the AI Green Addendum and gives it to the lender and to the appraiser. And then when the appraiser comes to do the inspection, they give the appraiser another copy of the AI Green Addendum to make sure they received it. The number of sales provides a trending for this new product. So this builder always alerts the appraiser as to how many homes they sold, how many were in the net zero energy category, how many were in the green category. So it's important that you follow that, think about it. Find a lender that knows about high performance, that will be willing to hire a competent appraiser and be willing to provide the documents, not only to the borrower, to the lender, but make another copy to give to the appraiser when they show up, because you're not assured that that appraiser ever got a copy of it.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Laura mentioned appraiser-driven studies, and that's mentioned in her document for Elevate Energy, "Unlocking the Value of High Performance Homes." We have in Denver, Colorado -- I'll talk about that one first -- it was a study on solar photovoltaic systems. It was released in May of 2013, and it was done by Lisa Desmarais, an SRA- designated appraiser with the Appraisal Institute. She used a methodology that I introduced to you at the very beginning here. She used the cost approach, she used the income approach, and she used paired sales on 30 home sales in that area. And came up with a sales price premium for solar photovoltaic, between $1.40 and $2.60. And you can Google the name there, or Bing search it, and come up with a copy of that report. Now that report is one that was written by appraisers, vetted by appraisers, and it's one that appraisers understand. And in that market area, they can use that as a basis for adjustment in their sales comparison approach. And Lawrence Berkeley National Lab is now working on another study that covers eight states. Now this is a hedonic modeling study that will come out first. This will be released here shortly, I would say sometime January-February. I served on the board or the review panel for this particular study. Again, it was hedonic modeling, so it's not a study that I can use in my appraisal report as a basis for an adjustment because I would have trouble explaining to an underwriter what hedonic modeling means. So my part in the study was to assist the programmer in identifying the features that builders -- appraisers would be looking at, and to review the study overall to see if it makes sense and it's logical. I give Lawrence Berkeley National Lab kudos because now they're going forward to do an appraiser-driven study, and that is in progress right now in these eight states. So appraisers will be doing the -- bringing out this cost, end cost, and paired sales to see how that matches up with hedonic modeling. So again in those eight states, this appraiser-driven study can be used by appraisers as a basis for their adjustment. These studies tell us that the value is more than zero. And what exactly the value is, the appraiser is responsible for drilling down to that value. So these appraiser-driven studies going forward on zero energy homes, Zero Energy Ready Homes, high-performance homes, not just solar photovoltaic -- it's important we get studies on all these done by appraisers, so the appraisers can use them in their everyday work product.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />This is that paired sale analysis that underwriters dream about and that appraisers go crazy over, because they are very difficult to do in many markets, especially if you're in a market that has a lot of custom home-building. So what we've done here is we've paired up a solar photovoltaic home with a home that's similar but it doesn't have solar. And this gave us a value here. We also show the sales price premium was $3.67 a watt, and this was a 2.99 kilowatt system. It was a little over two years old. We show that it has a gross cost, if you bought it, would be $6.37 a watt, and a net cost of $4.26. So this is the kind of thing that the underwriter would like to see from appraisers, not only on solar photovoltaic but on energy efficiency, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now, next steps. Clarification of the second mortgage market guidelines is really important. These are next steps to making your closing smoother and your real estate appraisal more accurate. Secondary mortgage market came out with on the 16th of this month, Fannie Mae, with their new guidelines. If you haven't seen them, download them. Because they do have some new things in there on solar PV, especially regarding leases. Appraisers are not allowed to give value in the market value for a leased system. We can for an owned system, but not for a leased system. That's Fannie Mae's guidelines. FHA's guidelines are the same, and so are Freddie Mac's. So we need a little more clarification, though. The Fannie Mae guideline that came out just says that we need to -- we make an adjustment for energy efficiency, we are to look at energy efficiency on our subjects and all our comparable sales. But we have to have market reaction to prove an adjustment. Now what does that mean? We need more clarity. The FHA guidelines will be coming out soon, the final draft of it. And it is more clear. It says the cost approach can be used, and the income approach can be used, when sales aren't available. So I would like to see that clarity in the Fannie Mae guideline, as well. We need more education, and Laura touched on that. We need to educate everybody. We need better populations in MLS green fields, which she's already talked about. A lot of those MLSes that have a green field aren't populated correctly, and that's due to lack of education. So we all play a part in that. As Laura has already talked about, documenting the number of houses. Appraisers have to have trending. We need to know, is this a growing movement in an area? If so, we can document this in the appraisal report, and it gives us more support for making our adjustments. We need to have our data accessible. And we need more appraiser-driven studies on geothermal, energy efficiency, green homes, solar, all of those things. We need more appraiser-driven studies. That will help move the needle further for a more accurate appraisal.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And, as Joe mentioned earlier, the "Residential Green Valuation Tools" is a book that I wrote earlier this year that the Institute published. The only one I'm aware of that really addresses all the tools, that will give you examples of how appraisers use your data, how we're using the AI Green Addendum. They're 67 pages in here dedicated to completing the AI Green Addendum. It takes you through every little line. It tells you where you can find that information to populate it. Don't let that scare you, because 67 pages includes a lot of graphics and pictures. But if you're a little intimidated by filling it out, this would be a good book for you to purchase to more accurately fill it out, to make it more meaningful to the appraisers. With that, can we pull up that poll of how often do you receive the HERS report? And then this would be to appraisers and real estate agents. I think we have a poll for that. Joe?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:<br />Next poll slide:</em><br />Yep, just launched. it.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />OK, good. And just like Laura said, I'd love to see the information on the solar and on the documents of the home inside the electrical box. From an appraiser's perspective, I can tell you, people will leave the home, they'll take the light bulbs, they'll take the kitchen sink, but they hardly ever take the electrical box. So your documents inside that electrical box, a sticker in there, will stay with that home to the second sale, to the third sale, to the fourth sale. My home was 23 years old when I purchased it, and the lady put all those important things inside there. So I have it now as the second owner.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />I'm going to give 10 more seconds to answer the poll.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />OK.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Alright, and it looks like 56 percent said never, 30 percent sometimes, 4 percent said 50 percent of the time, 0 percent said most of the time, 11 percent always.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />That needs improvement. So we've really got to get that whole HERS report -- not just the first page of it -- out to all the people. If you really want the fair value for your home, that's one way to do it. So let's make sure that we get those reports out to everyone.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And with that, I'll just say that I'm so glad you're all here, we're all in the same room talking about this, and I know that each of us play a part in making it better for tomorrow. And making this process go smoother. So my contact information is here. If you would like to email me afterward with any questions you have, I'd be glad to answer those. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Joe for final comments.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Alright, thanks, Sandy. We actually have a number of great questions, and we have a little bit of time to get through them. So I'd like to throw a few of them out there, and Laura and Sandy, if either one of you want to answer any of these, that would be great. First one we have is, what do you do when trying to compare a home with a HERS rating on it to a home or group of homes that do not have HERS rating? And is there any guidance on how to handle that situation?</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />OK, that's a great question and one that comes up a lot. And I'm assuming you mean, the property you're appraising has a HERS rating on it. So let's say, for instance, we have a HERS rating of 58. And we have that full report in our hands, and it tells us that we have an energy savings of $500 a year for this particular home. What the appraiser needs to do then is, if we have no homes with HERS ratings on them, but we have some fairly new homes -- let's say they're within the last -- they were built within the last year. Their actual sales have been last year. Year-old structures. What I do in my market is I go back to my building department and I ask them what a typical HERS rating is on a code-built home in my market area. In my market area, it's 85 right now. So that gives me a measurement. So I'm looking at homes that have a HERS rating of 85, compared to one with 58. And I know I have a $500 a month energy savings. So that gives me the basis for developing present value calculation, to come up with an adjustment for energy efficiency. Now, I always have to measure that against cost -- what was the cost premium to implement those energy efficiency features -- which I try to get from the builder, and the builders here are pretty good about helping us out with that. Then I look at the -- if I have a paired sale, I'll do a paired sale. But those are the three areas that I look at, to come up with those figures. Here's the problem. If you don't give the appraiser any documentation, you don't give them a HERS report but you just tell them it's high-performance, you're really just telling us to believe you. And unless we can actually document it, we have a big liability issue there, of assuming that what you're telling us is correct.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />OK, thanks. That's great. The next question we have is related to the green MLS and the fields that are available. A lot of these homes go out and get multiple certifications. It's sort of a NASCAR effect. They've got stickers everywhere. At least some of the attendees are reporting that the green MLS field only may give you an option for one of these certifications. Have you found that to be true, and what's the suggestion for how to get more of the certifications recognized?</p>
<p><em>Laura Reedy Stukel:</em><br />Sure. It's a great question. And one of the things, that map that I shared is an assessment of MLSes from a couple years ago. So there's a slightly tricky situation in that there wasn't a standard set of fields when the early adopters, which most of them are reflected in that map, put their fields together. So the good news is that your MLS -- 85 percent of the MLSes in these big markets have fields. The challenge is that if you compared them, there's probably not a whole lot that are exactly consistent. So I think the thing -- my recommendation, kind of a quick answer to this problem, is that MLSes are constantly working toward consistency. They're constantly upgrading their fields. And so a really good thing is if you have a contact with a Realtor in your market that you work with, and it's kind of your conduit to the MLS, or even if you reach out, some of them do have a committee, so it might take a little bit of digging if you go through the switchboard for the MLS. But here's the kind of buzz word that I would recommend people talk about. The Real Estate Standards Organization -- and I don't know if you guys have the option to share my screen, but I can put that field back up that's got the RESO data dictionary, if you want to do that. I'll talk through it in the meantime. But the Real Estate Standards Organization defines a data dictionary, which is now introducing consistently in terms of what fields MLSes offer, how they offer them. So the Green MLS Implementation Guide, which is pictured on this slide, and we'll send the link out to everybody, that sets the standard from this point forward for how MLSes approach handling the third-party verification. So, I would say it's not surprising that there's different ways to do this. However, now that there's a standard, what you can do when you're talking to the Realtors in your market or even if you're making a cold call to the MLS, what you can say is, once your plans become compliant with the RESO -- what it's called, data dictionary. So the good news is that now the fields for doing third-party verification is in the data dictionary. This Green MLS Implementation Guide, which I show there, is the next level of detail around what's in that data dictionary. But going back to the buzz word, what you want to be talking about is, what's the plan to migrate to green verification fields that are compliant with the RESO data dictionary? And that's what all MLSes are striving toward. Once there's a standard set of fields, they're all striving to start implementing that. Probably like a 12-, 24-month kind of timeframe. Something like that. So the good news is those fields that I show on this slide, No. 12, if you see that, either the technical fields or the programmers actually use. So what you see there, and I have a typo, but you see on that third one, Green, Type, Year Verified. What that means is you -- and it should apply to the earlier ones, but what it should say is, Green, Type, Building Verification. So the MLS would have it once for ENERGY STAR. So you have EPA ENERGY STAR and EPA Year Verified. And then you could go back and you'd have Zero Energy Home verification, DOE Energy Ready Home Year Verified, etc. etc. So the good news is that the precedent has been set, that there are more than one -- that these homes can get more than one verification, and that there's a means for the MLS to be able to accommodate that. So sorry -- that got into my geeky -- you hit my geeky technical sweet spot. But the good news is, if you remember those buzz words: What is your plan to become compliant with the green fields in the RESO data dictionary? That will help you understand when this is coming to your market, or to be able to help make the business case for accelerating it, if the answer is, well, we haven't thought of that yet.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Alright, thank-you for that. The next question we have is, is there any advice for what to do when an appraiser comes back with no added value for a certified home of some sort, an ENERGY STAR, Zero Energy Ready, or LEED or something like that?</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />OK, that's a great question. One I get a lot, I'm sure you can imagine. And first of all, I want to say that, if you don't sell it for more than your code-built houses, it's telling the market that it's not worth more. So you've got to sell it for more than a code-built home if you want it appraised for more, No. 1. No. 2 is, I would highly encourage you to get a copy of the appraisal. Now, the lender must give the borrower a copy of the appraisal a minimum of three days prior to closing. As soon as your borrower gets the word of what the appraised value is and gets a copy of the appraisal, as a builder I would ask you to encourage your borrower to share that appraisal with you. I do a wholesession on how to challenge the appraisal. The thing you want to do, the proper way to challenge an appraisal, is to look at the appraisal, No. 1, read through it carefully, and then highlight and write up any errors of fact. That's the only basis for a challenge, is that there are errors of fact. If they didn't use proper sales, and you know of better sales they should have used that would meet the guidelines within the last six months or a year, whatever the lender's guidelines are, then you take your written challenge to the lender and let the lender handle it. Do not call the appraiser. Because once the appraisal is completed, then the appraiser owes their confidentiality to the lender. So the lender should be the one communicating with them. Now, prior to doing the appraisal, when the appraiser calls you, you have a right to talk with them, to give them any information that you want to give them. And if you don't give them the documentation, don't expect a lot out of it. So they've got to have the documentation, because we can't just believe your word that the house is built the way you say it is. We need to have some kind of documentation. We need to have the AI Green Addendum. And again, look at the qualifications of the appraiser, as well. If the appraiser has some education, more than three hours, NAHB suggests that the appraiser must have a minimum of 14 hours. And the AI Green Registry requires 28 hours. Is that right? Yea, 28 hours at a minimum. So somewhere between 14 and 28 hours of tested education, not just a seminar or webinar. So that is how you would go about challenging that particular appraisal.</p>
<p><em>Laura Reedy Stukel:</em><br />Can I just add something there? One thing that I do, and I encourage everyone to do, is whoever is fielding the request to schedule the appraiser, make sure that you've got a checklist prepared for when that call comes in. So if you're the builder and you're selling this without a Realtor, I don't want to quite hear about that, but if you're selling it on your own, or through your sales center, whoever is scheduling the appraiser to come through, make a checklist for them. If it's your listing agent, make sure that they have a list. But as soon as that call comes in from the appraiser, and they say they're coming out, you want to say, great, what is your experience appraising other homes that were built above code? What is your experience specifically with Zero Energy Ready Homes? How often do you appraise homes in my market? And I think there's some confusion, without getting into too much detail, but there's some legislation called Dodd-Frank that introduced some separation between the appraiser and the seller, which is good. But I think it's caused some confusion about what type of questions are appropriate to ask an appraiser, what you can even ask. And so just know that those types of questions, to make sure that you're talking about what Sandy's talking about, you want to make sure you've got someone that understands, is local, understands the product that you're selling, and has some previous experience. So what I've heard, my experience is that the minute the appraiser comes on the driveway of the property, your ability to change an appraisal is much, much more complicated, because they've already come out under the premise that it was a code-built home. And so you've got to really catch that up front. And you can say, at that point in time, if you're asking the appraiser questions and you're not getting a comfort level, that's your cue to go back to the lender and say, hey, this is a different product. The appraiser that wants to come out, I'm not comfortable that they're qualified to do this. Can we go back and change things? And that's where you want to use appraisal addendum and say, look, this is someone that's got to have experience with these kind of factors on the home. And so that's my free advice for today, is the more you can do to pre-screen, your life becomes much easier to get and pay for the right appraiser the first time. Because the stuff that Sandy's talking about can be kind of complicated and a big headache.</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />And I agree with Laura. You have a right to ask those questions up front. And an appraiser should answer your questions to give you comfort level there.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />OK, we have time for maybe one more question. And the question is, can you talk a little bit, either of you, about why a HERS Index as opposed to something like say utility bills would be used for the green MLS or for appraisals in this process?</p>
<p><em>Sandy Adomatis:</em><br />Well, I can give you a great example why sometimes utility bills don't really mirror the energy efficiency of the structure. Locally, I was appraising an energy-efficient home. It was a green rated home, from plans and specs. And I was searching MLS and came up with a house that said energy efficient and in the comments section it said, the highest utility bill ever has been $125 a month. I got all excited and called the Realtor and found out that the Realtor said, well, that's really not a good comp. I said, why isn't it a good comp? He said, well, no one ever lived in the home. Now with the HERS Index, we know that the occupant level is one per bedroom, plus one. So, the appraisers are gaining more knowledge about the HERS Index. Now, if we use utility bills -- I'm not saying we can't use them -- but if the appraiser uses them, then on our subject property and on our comparables, we need to have some knowledge of how many occupants, is there any unusual plug load, is it a year-round home, or is it seasonal only? So there's a lot of things that come into play, and that it may be just that the occupants are energy-efficient and not the structure. So they may be turning the temperature way down or whatever. I do a study in the book that I wrote for my actual subdivision, where I used actual utility bills. And so if you get a chance to read that, you'll get a better feel for what I'm describing here.</p>
<p><em>Laura Reedy Stukel:</em><br />And let me just add, I hear a lot, I think the building community, remodeling, construction, whatever it is, it feels like I hear a lot that people want to get to one thing. And the experience that I've had is much different on the real estate side. And so we want a list of features, which most often can be -- a high level of that can be provided in the verification program. So some kind of high-level idea that this is different from a code home. We want the performance metrics like a HERS score or a home energy score, that's helpful and that tells us that the features that are there are contributing to performance. And then what I call the "BS Test" is that we like the utility bills because it provides the context for, is the performance metric accurate? So I think a lot of times people want just one thing, but consumers and real estate agents and appraisers, it's all so new to us, so we really are in a stage where we need those. Kind of it's a three- legged stool. So what are the features or measures, what's the performance, and then how is that established in the real world utility bills? So at least for the short term -- the next five, 10 years -- really if you can cover all three of those items, you give a lot more confidence to the real estate market. And then one other anecdote that I'll share, is that when we implemented that utility sharing information in Chicago, we found that that was very well- received, because cost, that's what consumers think about. And we joke that people factor in how many boxes of mac and cheese they might have to buy to go up to a certain home, or you know, sometimes the mac and cheese conversation comes in. But that's what they know. They know tax, they know mortgage, and utility cost is something that resonates a lot to them, at that point in time. And a lot of times consumers ask to see the utility bills. So we do see that in Chicago. I know of a couple MLSes that are talking about that. I've had some good conversations with the folks at Green Button. So there's certainly some opportunities that are possible in the future where we do make the utility costs at least more available to consumers, and then in the context of some of this other rich information that you're providing to us, by participating in programs like Zero Energy Ready Home, which gives us that context about features.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Thank-you. We are out of time, so if you didn't get your question answered today and would like an answer on it, you can email us at <a href="mailto:zero@newportpartnersllc.com">zero@newportpartnersllc.com</a> and we'll get you an answer or we can ask Sandy or Laura to respond. This webinar has been recorded and will be posted along with the rest of our webinar series on the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program website. And if you're looking for that, it's buildings.energy.gov/zero or just Google "Zero Energy Ready Home program" and you'll find it. Again, please let anyone who's interested know about the lender partner program that we're encouraging through DOE Zero Energy Ready program, and we look forward to seeing you all on future webinars. Thank-you.</p>
