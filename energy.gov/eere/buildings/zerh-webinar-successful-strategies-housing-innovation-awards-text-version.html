    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div  property="content:encoded" class="field-item odd"> <p>Here is the text version of the webinar Successful Strategies for the Housing Innovation Awards, presented in April 2016. <a href="https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/zerh-webinar-successful-strategies-housing-innovation-awards">Watch the presentation</a>.</p>
<p><em>Sam Rashkin:</em><br />... this advantage of being a partner with Zero Energy Ready Home that you can get recognition.</p>
<p><em>First presentation slide:</em><br />And, in fact, we think we've developed a recognition system; just the way a house is a system, so is recognition. So I'd like to, instead of just dumping you into a whole bunch of process about the Housing Innovation Awards, kind of provide context for how it fits within the larger system of recognition that we have in this program. So moving to the next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />What I want to first cover is just our challenge. If you label programs or if we as program providers are out there communicating about what we do, it's not simple. We have an average home to minimum code that has annual energy use. And if you hit it again, Joe. What we do with our program, we optimize the efficiency of that home with really good enclosure and components, and then on top of that, we ensure performance, in terms of moisture, comfort, indoor air quality, and solar- readiness. And then we earn the label Zero Energy Ready Home. If I hit it one more time, now we're ready to go to Zero whenever we would add a renewable energy system during or after construction. So hit it one more time. This is not an easy story. Getting this conveyed to a buyer is a challenge. So what we've had to do is come up with our core, and what is this program really about?</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />If we're stuck in an elevator for 15, 20 seconds, what would we tell a consumer about this label? And this is what we've kind of come up with. It's not better health, better comfort, better efficiency. At the end of the day, what is the bigger, more substantial point about Zero Energy Ready Home? And it's this: It's that it's the expert's choice. It's a home that if you had the best, wisest people who knew the most about housing together, it's a home they would insist upon, that home or better. They would not buy anything less, and particularly given it's the largest purchase of a lifetime. And this in fact is the subject of a whole video that we're developing. I'm just going to tee up a few of the setup points, and then I'll leave it for you to kind of look for this video coming forward. But if you hit the next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The key point we have is that we want to first convey to buyers that you've got one opportunity during construction to get it right. And there are so many things that you can't see when you buy a home. And a lot of your experience will depend on what you do: the technologies, construction practices you choose, and those cannot be changed. So go to the next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Our key message, that is, experts know that Zero Energy Ready Home gives you seven must-have systems that deliver a better living experience. And next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And so what we do in our video, and I'll stop here with what we're doing, with this slide, is that we deliver seven must-have systems that any expert would insist upon in their homes. They want optimized thermal protection. They want to know that the house is moisture-ready and the house is comfort-ready, and they want to know that the house is technology-ready with energy- efficient components. They want to know the house is health- ready with indoor air quality improvements. They want to know it's zero-ready with solar-ready construction. And they want to know that it's performance-ready because of all the quality assurance details that go into each and every home. And so really what our video does, is it uses this -- the home that experts would choose is this big overarching core that we are about. And then it hangs all the things we deliver on that core. So to go to the next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />What we've done is sent this script, if you will, over to a much more professional marketing firm than our team itself. And we're basically having a video prepared as we speak. So it will ready in June, and it will be posted on the Tour of Zero. And so that is very significant, because our goal is to send a broad swath or broad stretch of the public interested in buying new homes to our website to see the home of the future that's available today. And it could begin with the context about the home of the future, and the fact that it's the home the experts would choose, and then they can click on the map, on the area of interest. Joe, hit that slide one more time. And then wherever your area of interest -- let's say it was Pennsylvania -- up would come the homes where they could take a tour in their market.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And so now instead of just taking the Tour of Zero by itself, you're taking the Tour in context of it's a home the experts would choose. And the Tour, the way it works without going through it in too much detail, is, of course, first you have all the pictures inside and outside the home, and some details are occasionally shown.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then, after you go through the pictures, you get some very simple, easy statistics and information about the home. You get testimonials and the headlines on the left bar. You get the list of features that are in the home. And friendly terms based on experience, not the technical terms. You get the floorplans. And you get the home's statistics so that homeowners or the clients can learn about homes and experience them, hear testimonials, see the pictures. And home after home, you're seeing a whole different experience for homeowners. And again, it's always linked to, this is the home an expert would choose. Now if you go to the next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />We also leverage our core about being a home experts would choose in all the information, including the consumer fact sheets about our program that are customized for each builder. And even here, if we have a buyer who's interested, let's say, in a healthful environment, -- we know that their kids use inhalers or have asthma -- we would circle that. And if you go to the next slide.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Again, what we're saying is that we have all the experts tell us what should go into a home to protect the health of our children. We have 100 percent of those recommendations. In fact, those are the recommendations from a leading authority in health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and we meet the requirements of their Indoor airPLUS label. You get about half those measures in your ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup> Certified Home, and you get hardly any of those in an existing home. So again, this is the home the experts would choose for health. And we're going to show why experts would choose this for all the attributes: energy, comfort, durability, quality, technology. All the things that you want a house for -- this is the home that has all the most recommendations by the leading experts. And so we keep pounding on our core. That's what we do.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />On the next slide, you can see that we do the same thing with our brochure. Again, it features the same bars, the same "We have what the experts recommend," and it's a great choice for consumers. So moving on, in terms of context, go to the next slide, Joe.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The Housing Innovation Awards doesn't just sit as an isolated piece of recognition. By winning a Housing Innovation Award, you automatically become part of the Tour of Zero, and your home is placed in the Tour of Zero. And in addition, you get the Housing Innovation Award recognition on the housing locator where consumers find you on our website, so that is found there. And if you go to the next pages, you also have the Housing Innovation Award to use for recognition on your own marketing.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So here is Cobblestone Homes. And look how nicely they get enhanced in their recognition, once they've won the Housing Innovation Award. Now their website features this distinction. In addition, if you look at other ways that our builders take this award, they use a whole array of different new social media outreach efforts to target their audience with this distinguished, leading award.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And there's lots of ways that you can market that you've won a national award. Only 1 percent of the builders in the nation are demonstrating they can meet this level of excellence and, again, tie it around the core of a level of excellence that every leading expert would choose to have in their next new home. So that's the context for the Housing Innovation Awards. It's setting you up so that you'll be recognized at a much higher level. It gets your homes into the Tour of Zero, which is a good thing for us. We need consumers to see more and more of the best Zero Energy Ready Homes in the market and to see that there's a different consumer experience with these homes. So at this point I'm going to turn it over to Joe so he can walk you through the process of how you can work with us to apply for your getting recognition, And do realize that you can submit a number of homes. We're trying to get a lot of experience out to consumers that amazing things are happening with the home of the future. So I'm going to hand it on to Joe.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:<br />Next slide:</em><br />Thanks, Sam. That was a great intro, and I know that I always get excited around this time of year, when we start this process, because we really do get to see an amazing array of homes that are submitted here, and get to try to help tell that story. So I'm going to spend the rest of the webinar trying to walk through the application process. It can be a little confusing, and we don't want it to be confusing. So we want to try to explain how to go about this process. Then also point out some of the things that sometimes get missed in applications, and carving that application when it comes to award time. So please keep in mind that everything Sam talked about is a real benefit of participating in the Housing Innovation Awards. We do guarantee that any Housing Innovation Award winner will get a Tour of Zero profile, and we work hard to include all applicants with deserving applications on the Tour of Zero, as resources allow. But our goal is to get as many of these homes on the Tour as possible, and all Housing Innovation Award winners will be included. So just to go through the high levels of the process. The basics are that you download the application form, and that form will be available starting May 1 on the Housing Innovation Awards website. And I will show you that in a minute, after I take you through these slides. Next is to complete that form, filling out everything and compiling any supporting materials, like pictures and floorplans and testimonials that the application asks for. Then you actually submit this application through your DOE Zero Energy Ready Home partner profile online. So if you're not registered as a DOE Zero Energy Ready Home partner, you will need to do so before you're able to submit applications. And as I said, I will show you that portal in just a moment. So after you begin your online application and upload your completed form and all your supporting materials, then you press the submit button, and it gets sent to us, and it will be available for review for our judges that way. You don't have to email any large files to us. It's all submitted online.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So when you're applying for the Housing Innovation Awards, we have a number of categories that are open for you, that we hope cover the wide variety of types of homes that are built under the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program. First we have the custom category, and that's custom for a buyer. So this is homes that are built for a specific buyer and built using custom methods. We try to separate the categories so we have as many like homes competing against each other as possible. Next we have a new category this year, and that's the custom or built to spec category. This category captures two general types of homes. One is sort of a custom home that is not built for a specific customer but simply built to spec. And separating that out from the custom homes helps because there are bonus points for homeowner testimonial, and sometimes these homes don't have a homeowner yet when they're submitted. The other type of home that we would suggest being submitted in this category is a demonstration home by a production builder. So if you're a builder who does a production model or perhaps or a semi- production model where you're not high-volume but you have set plans, this would be the appropriate category for you to put in a home that maybe isn't being built on production scale but it is built to a specific set of plans without a buyer in mind. Next we have production homes, and this category has changed a little bit from last year. This is not just homes built by a builder who uses a production model. But it's also built by builders who have certified four or more DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes since last June. That's when we had our last application, too. So the point here is that if you are a production builder who wants to submit a home, but that home is a demonstration project, or that home is not being built on a production scale, that's really more appropriate for the spec category and not for this category. This category is meant to recognize builders who are building these homes at a production level. And we set the bar pretty low. Four homes isn't a lot for a production builder. But the idea here is that this category is for the builders who are participating in the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program at more than just a demonstration level but actually at a production level. Next we have the multifamily category, and that's a building or units with more than two units serving multiple homeowners or renter groups. So this could be one unit within a multifamily building but more appropriately it would be a building of multifamily units. And that's probably what we expect to see. And then finally we have the affordable category, and this is homes built to an affordable price point. They can be nonprofit or for-profit, but keep in mind that if you're submitting a for-profit project that you will need to make the case as to why this home is affordable. And a home sold at a nonaffordable price point will be less competitive in this category.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Finally, we will have two levels of awards. Each of the categories that I just mentioned will have a group of awardees that are Housing Innovation Award winners. And we like to get a number of people in these categories so that we can have a good competition for the grand award level. Each category will have one grand award winner selected who is sort of the best of that category. So we will be recognizing people at the award level and then also at the grand award level. Awards -- we will send out the notification of that by the end of June, or that's our target. So that you'll be able to make plans to travel to our award ceremony at EEBA in Dallas this year. Grand award winners will not be announced until the award ceremony. And again, that will be taking place at the EEBA conference in Dallas in September. So if you do get notified that you are an award winner, we'd love it if you could attend the award ceremony, and you won't find out whether you've won the grand award or not until that ceremony evening.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now I'd like to talk about some of the questions I get often during this time of year. The first is, can a home be submitted if it's not DOE Zero Energy Ready Home certified? And the answer is no. So if you have a really great LEED home or a really great home certified under a local green-building program, or a really amazing ENERGY STAR home, or some home that's designed to the Living Building Challenge or something like this, that's great. But it needs to go through the certification process for the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program if it's going to be selected for a Housing Innovation Award. So that's just something to keep in mind. If you're considering applying and haven't gotten the certification done, please talk to me and I will help you try to walk through the process and determine whether it's feasible at this point or not. Next question I get quite often is, can I apply for a home that's not finished? And the answer is probably not. If you have a home that's testing a week after the applications close and everything else is final, we would let you submit that home as long as we get final certification before giving a ruling on whether it's an award winner or not. But if the home is weeks or months out from being finished, then it's more appropriately submitted for next year's award. Can I use my own format to submit to the awards? We would prefer that you don't use your own format. We'll be going through the application form in just a few minutes. But having everyone submit in the same form makes it much easier on the judges to review, and it also makes it much easier on the Pacific Northwest National Lab team who create the Tour of Zero profiles, when they try to compile and format those profiles. Do I have to answer all the required sections? And the answer is yes. This is one of the areas where we see the most common set of problems in an application, where there's a required section that's not completed, and then the judges don't really know how to score that application, because there's points assigned to that section and they can't assign any points. And then finally, where do I upload my application? I'm going to show you the portal in a moment, but again it's in your DOE Zero Energy Ready Home partner profile. And you'll need to sign in to that to be able to upload an application. Next: My files won't upload -- what do I do? Please give me a call. And I'll have contact info at the end of this PowerPoint, and there are also ways to contact us through the website -- through the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home website. Please don't hesitate to ask us questions. We are here to help you with the application process.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So common application problems that we see. And there are a number of them that have come up over the last few years. The first is that applications are started and never submitted. So I can see in the application portal on my end everyone who's started an application. And we actually had probably twice as many applications started last year as were actually submitted. And we do try to follow up with those partners encouraging them to fully submit. But people often do get through part of the process and not finish it. Required areas of the application not being completed. Again, I just covered that, but this is going to seriously hurt your chances of getting an award if you don't answer the required sections. Unresponsive or minimally responsive answers is a problem that may not stop you from getting an award but may prevent you from being competitive at the grand award level. Sometimes we'll have an answer on, say, business metrics, where the answer is, I do 100 percent of my homes this way. Well, that's not a very complete answer when we're trying to talk about how this building has -- building method and strategy has impacted your business. So think about how you can fully answer any question that's in the application. The judges will really appreciate that, and it will be reflected in your score. If they can't get any picture of your story from your application, they're not going to be able to judge it well. Next is irrelevant pictures. So make sure that the pictures you're submitting with the application help to explain why this home is so great. I've seen a few pictures submitted that might be a picture of a mirror in a hallway. And while it's a really great-looking mirror, it's not really relevant to anything about the application process. It doesn't even really tell us that much about interior design. So just keep an eye on that as you're picking your pictures, that any picture you're submitting really tells us something about the home. Next: Not enough pictures to adequately depict the home. So if the judges can't get a good idea of what this home is like from the pictures you're submitting, they're not going to be able to adequately judge it. The next problem we run into is limited construction detail, especially if you have something unique about your home. So for example, if you're using a really unique HVAC system, and that's a big part of the value message of the home or the performance of the home, make sure you include some pictures so they can see some of that while they're reviewing it. And then finally, missing the chance to tell your success story. All of the homes submitted in this process are going to be DOE Zero Energy Ready Home certified, so all of them are extremely high- performing homes, extremely energy-efficient homes. So one of the mistakes I see is a reliance on a low HERS score, for example, to win the award, where all the homes being submitted have an impressive HERS score. And you want to make sure you're telling why this home is special and why it's a success. And then one more thing is not asking staff for help. Please, if you have a problem, I am here to help. And I want to help people get as many complete applications in as possible so that we have a really great award year.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Here is my contact information. I will put it up again at the end of the webinar. And like I said, most of our materials on the website has ways to get to me to contact, as well. So please don't hesitate to email me. Don't hesitate to call me. And I will help walk you through the process if you're having trouble. So at this point I'd like to take everyone over to the application form.</p>
<p><em>View of application form:</em><br />And again, this is something that we're going to require to be filled out, and then it needs to be uploaded into the application portal. For any of you who have applied in past years, this is a little bit different because we now have it in an Excel form. Before you get scared by the size and complexity of this document, all of the content, or 90 percent of the content, was present in the Word document form from last year, but we think this will help people to track what they've answered and what they haven't, and maybe cut down on incomplete applications. So the content is pretty much the same. We're not dramatically increasing the complexity of the application from last year, but we did want to try to find a way to make sure we notified people when they're not completing the application. So the first tab in this spreadsheet, this application form, is the instructions tab. And I'm not going to go through all of the instructions now, but if you have questions about what you're supposed to do and the general process, this tab lays it out for you as well as due dates and the date of the award ceremony.</p>
<p><em>Next tab of form:</em><br />The next tab covers what documentation we would like. So this is sort of the summary tab that's going to tell us all the things you should be including as you're compiling your supporting material. And you'll notice there's a checkbox here. Well, I can go in and I say, OK, I did my application form. And I found my photographs. And I found my floorplan, and I've got a utility bill that shows actual performance data. And that way I can go through and check all of the things that need to be submitted and make sure that I'm not forgetting anything.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />Next tab we have the application tracker, and as you fill out this spreadsheet, each of these sections that now say "Incomplete" are then going to change to "Complete." So if you have a question about whether you haven't filled anything out, go to this application tracker, and it will tell you.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />The next tab is the general information tab. So this is where we're going to see anything about the home and the builder that's going to tell us basically the summary of this home. So here's where you're going to pick what type of home or category you're applying for. So let's say I'm doing an affordable home. I'm going to pick that, and you can see there's the definitions of the categories right there to the right. Then I can pick what type of home this is. And let's say it's a single family detached home. Then I'm going to go in and fill in my contact information as the builder, or the contact information as the third-party rater. There are times when HERS raters will fill these out for the builder. That's fine. We would like the contact information for both filled in. And then you can see we have more project-specific information. Again, all of this was on the form last year, just in Word format. So now I'm going to check my compliance task. 99 percent of homes are certified DOE Zero Energy Ready Home via the performance task. I'm going to put a name or project. You can always put "not applicable" if there is something that's not applicable. I'm going to fill out all of this information about the homes -- number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, whether there's a finished basement or not. And then you'll see over here there's an ENERGY STAR Homes certification. There's where we want to fill in whether it was certified as ENERGY STAR version 3 or version 3.1. And then you'll have an option to fill in any optional programs that you also were certified for. This can help the judges know when you're in fact going beyond the minimum requirements of the program. You'll notice that those fields for the optional programs are not in red because you don't have to fill them out if you don't have them. But if I don't fill out, say, my climate zone, it's going to stay red. If I do put something in there, I all of a sudden see that it's in blue and I filled it out. So if you see red in these -- in this spreadsheet, you know that you're still missing some information. You look down a little bit further, there's a place where we try to get some of the program metrics. All of this data -- it may seem like a lot of data -- but all of this data is data that we collect to help create the Tour of Zero profile. So if you don't have this data, then someone in the past would have to call you and interview you for it, so it saves everyone involved a lot of time if it's entered right away. I would also note that most of the data on energy cost and energy savings are found on your HERS reports for the DOe Zero Energy Ready Home certification. So you shouldn't have to create those numbers. The other thing I note is on incremental costs, because we do have some confusion on that. This is incremental costs just for the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home items. This is not incremental costs that include everything that you do for your home that's above code. So for example, if you put in a really great top-of-the-line sprinkler system in your home, and it's not required by code in your jurisdiction, that's not an incremental cost that we want reflected here. Sometimes we'll see an incremental cost number that shows -- that seems really high, but it's not really related to the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home provisions. It's related to something else that the builders put in. So that is the general information tab.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />Now on the performance tab, this is where you put in all of the performance details about the home and the construction details. This is where we talk about the fact that I'm using an ICF wall or a SIPs wall or a double 2-by-4 wall, or a wall with advanced framing or something like that. This is where I'm going to talk about the fact that my windows are triple-paned or my air- sealing is down at 0.18 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure. This is sort of the technical tab. And I'll say that this is an area that a lot of builders focus their applications on, which is appropriate -- it's an important category. But it's not the only important category. So as you fill out these sections, each one will turn blue. And if I say water conservation features, I have efficient hot water distribution, I see that that then gets filled out, and if I go back to my application tracker, you'll see that the water conservation features portion of the performance tab is complete. And that will happen as you go throughout this tab. If there is something that really doesn't apply, like you really don't have any other measures with it, put "n/a," so that you at least will be able to look at the application tracker and know that it's done. But in most cases, these will all apply. The next category that the homes are judged on is land development. And I just want to stress how important it is to fill out all of these required categories. The judges are going to judge based on the six major categories. There's performance, land development, design, quality construction, business metrics, and sales and marketing. And then there are additional bonus points available. If you don't fill one of these categories out, you're going to be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to the judging. Land development. Sometimes I hear, well, I'm a custom builder, and I'm just building on the lot that my customer owns, so there wasn't really any choice in the site. If that's the case, then try to think about how you're handling site-specific conditions. Every site is unique in its own way and has its own challenges. So talk about how you oriented the home, based on the solar availability, or talk about how you dealt with specific run-off issues. Talk about if you've got an infill lot, how you handled that. Even if you have no choice in the site selection, talk about how you're dealing with the site-specific conditions.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />The next tab is design. So this is architectural design, but then it's also other performance design, like disaster resistance, sustainable materials, and that sort of thing. Again, this is often something that gets kind of a light treatment in applications, and I would just encourage you to really give some thought to how building DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes is integrated with your design, and how your design helps to sell that performance. And again, if I put something in the design category, like I say that it's a modern design, and then obviously I go on to write a whole paragraph about that, that's going to be completed there in blue, and if I go back to my application tracker, I'll now see that that section is complete.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />So moving on to the next category, quality construction. This could be either formal or informal examples of quality assurance / quality control methods that you have in place. So for example, you could put something about a specific quality control program you have, or you could talk about the type of methods or checklists that you use on-site to make sure that things are done correctly.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />Business metrics is the next category, and this is really meant to try to capture some of the benefits of building and selling DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes. So this is -- the type of metric we're thinking about here are things like, well, my time to sale was decreased by half. Or I've noticed a 30-percent increase in sales since building this way. Or, I was able to charge a 30- percent cost premium based on building this way. And maybe it's an increase in marketing or it's an increase in the ability to use free marketing based on the interest and PR surrounding your project. So try to think about in this tab, why is building DOE Zero Energy Ready Homes, or even a home, a successful strategy for you? How does it make business sense for you? Now if you have a situation where maybe you're a nonprofit organization submitting for the affordable category, don't leave this section blank. There are other things that you could cover in here that may not have to do with higher sales price or something like that. Maybe it's how building this way fits into your program's mission, or how building this way ensures your end customer, maybe in need of an affordable home, the ability to meet their utility bills on a month-to-month basis. Try to talk about sort of the business end, even though you're not a for-profit business. So why does building this way make sense for your organization and their mission?</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />Next is the sales and marketing and consumer education section. So this is examples and strategies of how you go about selling this type of home. So what are you offering? How are you messaging the value around these homes? Again, if you're a nonprofit group maybe who doesn't have to sell because they've got an end customer already lined up for their product, maybe focus more on the consumer education part. How do we make sure that our occupants are going to be prepared for living in a high-performance home, is what that means. So there is always something that we can put here.</p>
<p><em>Next tab:</em><br />And then finally, there are the bonus options. Here, we have several categories that will get you bonus points if you have something here. First is if you have a quote or homeowner testimony, or occupant testimony that deals with why this home is so great. If you have an audio or video testimony, that's even better. So if you've got that, please include a link here or include a separate Word document in the other attachments section, which I'll show you in just a moment, with a link to, say, a YouTube video with that testimony. And that can be a really powerful way to convey the value of these homes and how they're affecting your customers. If you have actual utility bills or other monitored data, that's another way that you can get bonus points. If you can't include the description here in the spreadsheet, just note that it will be included along with your application, and then please remember to actually include it. And then finally, we have a section on your story. This is, again, a bonus section. You don't have to fill this out. But I will say that the Pacific Northwest National Lab, who do a great job pulling these profiles together, will be calling and asking you these questions, as they're trying to create the Tour of Zero profile. So if you don't fill it out here, you will still have to answer them, if you want a complete Tour of Zero profile, so you might as well get the bonus points and fill out that narrative. But if it's too prohibitive, that's still an optional category.</p>
<p>So again, once I've filled out all of these sections, I should see all green complete here in the application tracker. And I hope that that won't be too hard, but again, if you're having problems with the form, I'm happy to help you through it. Now I'd like to show you the portal that you'll use to upload your applications.</p>
<p><em>Website view:</em><br />And I'll go through this fairly quickly so we can get some questions here at the end. On May 1, we will have -- the Housing Innovation Awards website will be updated, so that you can download that form directly from there, the spreadsheet form. But then to actually enter it, you need to go into your partner profile online. So if you sign in to your partner profile on the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home page, you will be able to go in and upload your application. You'll see, this is the normal view you get. You can look at marketing materials and that sort of thing in your profile. But there's also going to be on May 1, open the Housing Innovation Awards application. And you'll see here, whether you have already submitted one or whether you have some in process. So if I want to create a new application, the first step that I do is I name this application. So I'll name this "Newport Application 1," and I'll save it just to make sure that it's in the system. Then I'm going to go through and I'm going to select what I'm doing here. So I was doing an affordable project. And now I'm going to upload the application form that I just completed. So you can see that when I add files, and select that file, it will now, at the bottom of the screen, be on my list of files that I can upload. And I can upload all my files at once, or I can do them one at a time. So if I push the "Start upload file," now that completed application is uploaded in the system. I'm then going to go through to each of these sections and upload any other documents I have. We do require that you include the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home certification information. This is available to be printed using the HERS raters software. So please make sure that you upload those in the appropriate spots. Each project is required to submit floorplans. Then we have a number of pictures that we'd like to see. We'd like to see at least 10 photographs, although I would encourage you to submit more than 10. As I said before, the more detail you can show, the better. So if I go to my pictures for the project, I'm going to submit -- and don't pay any attention to what the detail in these pictures; these are just random construction details. But for you, I hope that you submit relevant pictures. You'll see that we now break these down into categories. And we'd like at least three in each of these categories.</p>
<p>And now, so I put three in each of these categories. And it should give you a warning if you don't have at least three. And then finally, I need a total of 10. So you can have four in one category, or you can have something in the other categories. Ten or more. And then you'll notice down here that all of these files are ready to be uploaded and I can just go in and click "Upload all." I could also click "Cancel" if I didn't like one of the photos I chose. So this process is then going to allow you to upload these things. If you have any other attachments, like say you have a link in a Word document to a YouTube video that you want to show. You can submit that in the "Other" attachments category. That's an optional category, but that's where you put other supporting materials. Then finally, the marketing materials. That's something if you've got a really great homeowner brochure or a really great picture of a yard sign that you use, or a billboard or maybe it's a link to an ad, or a screenshot of a Google ad that you use. Those can be uploaded there. So anything extra that you've got, you can just use that portal. And then once you have everything uploaded, you can see that everything here has been uploaded, you need to push "I agree" that we're allowed to use these photos and other materials that's part of the application process, and then push "Submit." Don't forget to push "Submit." If you don't push that button, it won't finalize. So I'm going to push "Submit." I get a little note there that says the application has been submitted, and if I look back at the HIA application page, I'll see that application there and listed. So I have created a custom home and I've created an affordable home. It's perfectly appropriate for you to submit under multiple categories, if you have that available. You could also, if you have very different style homes, if you'd like to submit under the same category, that would be appropriate, as well, keeping in mind that the Tour of Zero, if they're very similar homes, similar plans, you'll get less value out of having multiple homes in the process. But varied design and floorplans are appropriate to submit multiples. So that's the process. I know we probably have some questions here. We've gone through this fairly quickly. Again, I'm just going to put up this last slide here while we answer some questions. And please do not hesitate to call me. Everybody, write down my contact information. And I'm going to walk you through the process if you're having difficulty.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I'm going to ask Sam Bowles here at Newport to read me some of the questions, and we'll answer as many of them as we can before 3 o'clock, and then again we will follow up with you if we can't get to your question.</p>
<p><em>Sam Bowles:</em><br />OK, so two questions that came in were kind of related. One of them is going to be, if a builder wants to submit more than one home how should they go about doing it? And the next related question is, is there an advantage to submitting more than one home?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />I would say that the best advantage to submitting more than one home is, again, when you have different approaches or very different style of homes to submit. So let's say you're a custom builder and you have sort of a large high-end custom home, and then you have maybe a different style more-modest custom home. If they're different enough in style, it does make sense to submit both. If you've got a townhouse row and you've also got single-family homes, maybe you could submit the townhouses -- that project under multifamily, while doing your single-family under production, for example. And then sometimes a builder will have market-ready and affordable, and certainly submit both there. If you've got multiple homes in the same category, it just depends on how different they are, whether it's worth -- whether there's an advantage in submitting them. Again, if you've got three of the same model, there may not be an extreme advantage of submitting that. In the Tour of Zero; they're all going to look basically the same. But if they're significantly different, then that could get you some extra PR. As far as winning an award or a grand award, again, if you've got three very similar homes, or four or five very similar homes, there does not appear to be an advantage in having all of them submitted, as far as likelihood of getting chosen for the award. Because the judges are differentiating on all of the different required aspects that we've talked about today. And if the homes are similar enough, those are not going to be very different between them.</p>
<p><em>Sam Rashkin:</em><br />In that same vein, I'll also say that if you submit multiple homes, you won't detract from your possibility to win the grand award. So the jurors do get together and do on balance pick what's the best ambassador for the program by their selection of the grand award. So the advantage is real simple. It's more exposure, it's more presence in the Tour, and as Joe says, just make sure each home is different.</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Thanks, Sam.</p>
<p><em>Sam Bowles:</em><br />We have another question: What should you do if your project is relevant to two categories, for example, multifamily and affordable?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />I would try to pick what the most relevant category is. We don't want one home submitted for multiple categories. So think about what the central message around your project is, and try to focus on that. So for example, if you've got an affordable, multifamily building, what makes it unique? Most likely, in my opinion, you would have a better shot going with the multifamily category, because the affordable aspect will add another level in competing in the multifamily section. So if you're a multifamily building, it's most appropriate to be considered against other multifamily buildings. But if you've got an affordable aspect to your project, it may make sense to try to highlight that as a benefit within the multifamily category. On the other hand, if you don't feel like your project will be competitive with, say, a high-end multifamily project -- maybe everything is very minimalist as far as design and cost of features, still a very high-performing project, but not extravagant, you may find that you want to submit that under affordable. In general, I would say that it will be better to submit any multifamily building, especially apartment buildings, under the multifamily category.</p>
<p><em>Sam Bowles:</em><br />Another question that came through: If a builder wants to add homes completed in 2014 to the Tour of Zero, can they still apply for the award this year?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />I would say please contact us and let's talk about the specifics of the project. If there's a home that is deserving for the Tour of Zero, we'll certainly try to get it on. We're trying to focus these awards on homes completed within the last award year, however, we also understand that there are some times where a home is maybe completed slightly outside of that range, like maybe it was a few months before awards closed but there was no chance to get it submitted properly. We would consider having you submit that for this cycle. The home is significantly old, we would want to think about whether that's appropriate for the awards, but again, if we have a deserving project, we would do our best to get it on the Tour of Zero.</p>
<p><em>Sam Bowles:</em><br />One more question: What would a higher-end rehab for an owner be categorized as?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />Gut rehabs can be certified as DOE Zero Energy Ready Home. It's not our common group of homes. But it does happen every once in a while. Most that we see are affordable projects, but if you have a high-end gut rehab -- again, that's fully certified as DOE Zero Ready -- then I would submit that under custom for buyer. So if it's not an affordable project and it is a full gut rehab that is certified DOE Zero Ready, then I would go with the custom for buyer section.</p>
<p><em>Sam Bowles:</em><br />A couple more here I think we can get to pretty quickly. To submit marketing / PR materials, can we download a link to a magazine article that featured the home, or do we just scan it in as a PDF?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />You can certainly submit links. You could have, in fact, an entire Word document full of links. I would recommend labeling them clearly and saying what they are and also mentioning them in your application. However, I would just caution you that in some cases, links to articles expire or you need a specific log-in to access that publication. If that's the case, then a PDF of the article might be a better choice. But if it's an open article that anyone can access and the judges won't have trouble getting to it, and you don't expect that article to go away, then certainly a link is fine. But if you have any question then I would PDF it. Let's do one more question.</p>
<p><em>Sam Bowles:</em><br />OK. This one's kind of related to one we got before. Would a home completed in 2015 already entered qualify?</p>
<p><em>Joe Nebbia:</em><br />If it was completed in 2015, you could certainly enter that. We're really looking for June to June completions, but if it's a little bit outside of that range, that's fine. If it's already been entered and awarded, we don't want to see it again. If you've received a Housing Innovation Award in the past, we don't want that home entered again. If there was some issue, like there was a problem with your application last year and the home is deserving but it was some sort of issue where the home wasn't awarded, then yes, you could submit that again. We don't want those from years and years ago, but from last year, if there was an issue where maybe the application wasn't complete and it couldn't be awarded, certainly submit that again.</p>
<p>So that's all we have time for, as far as questions. Again, we do have all of the questions get recorded in the webinar system, so we can follow up with you and answer them. This webinar has been recorded and will be posted on the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home website, under the "Resources" tab. And I've left my contact information up there for a long time. So please give me a call or send me an email if you have follow-up questions. And I look forward to another great year of outstanding Housing Innovation Award applications. So thank-you all for attending.</p>
