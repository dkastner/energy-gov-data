<p><em>Alex Krowka:</em><br />Welcome to DOE Zero Energy Ready Home orientation webinar. We're really excited that you can join us today for this overview of the Zero Energy Ready Home program, including the business case and how to be recognized by the DOE as an industry partner. Our presenters today are DOE ZERH program staff, Jamie Lyons, Joe Nebbia and Sam Rashkin. My name's Alex Krowka. I provide coordination support for the program, and I'll be covering some general notes on webinar housekeeping. All attendees will be in listen-only mode, however, we invite you to ask questions throughout the session in the questions section of the GoToWebinar program. We'll monitor these throughout the webinar, and after the presentation we'll have about 15 minutes or so to go over your submitted questions. This session will be recorded and placed on the resources page of the Zero Energy Ready Home website. Please allow some time for this, because it can take a bit to go through the process of being added online. Also, after the webinar we'll send out an email with a PDF of the presentation and some information on our upcoming webinars. So now I'm going to hand it over to Jamie Lyons to give an introduction to the program and introduce our presenters.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />OK, thank-you, Alex, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon, or this morning depending on where you're logging in from.</p>
<p><em>First slide of presentation:</em><br />So this is our orientation webinar for DOE Zero Energy Ready Home, so we assume that the majority of today's participants are part of the program as partners. So to our builder partners, we offer congratulations that they're among the select group of the top 1 percent of builders in the country that are building to these high, extraordinary levels for efficiency, but also for comfort, health, safety, durability, and quality, all those things. In doing so, providing a great amount of value to homebuyers. On the energy side, 40 to 50 percent more savings, which is really set up for the home to migrate at some point, if the owners choose to go there, to zero energy or near zero energy. And also along the way, these builders are able to differentiate from the competition, the vast majority of homes in the market, which are existing home sales. These new homes, which are rolling in all the solid building science we get from ENERGY STAR<sup>®</sup> Homes v. 3, and layered on top of that, really good innovations, proven innovations, coming out of DOE's Building America R&amp;D program. Package that up, and that's a tremendous value proposition to buyers that builders can use to differentiate themselves in the market. So hats off to our partners, and we're grateful that you're part of the Zero Energy Ready Home program.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Quick overview of where we're going over the next hour. Five sections. We assume most of our attendees are partners, but we always do like to recap why our builders and their partners are in this space of Zero Energy Ready. We'll talk a little bit about the program's specifications, just sort of the short version on that. And we'll dive into the marketing resources, technical resources, and just some tips and ideas on getting the most out of your partnership to help you gain success.</p>
<p><em>Poll question screen:</em><br />So real quick, before I hand it over to the program lead, who is Sam Rashkin, chief architect of DOE's Building Technologies Office, I just want to launch a quick poll just so we have a good idea of who is joining us today, in terms of whether you're a new partner, not yet a partner, an existing partner, or an existing partner who's been active in building / qualifying homes. We'll let the poll results roll in on this for the next minute or two -- or excuse me, the next few seconds. And then Sam, I'll migrate the presentation over to you in just a second. Close the poll here in just a second, but I'm seeing a bit of a mix of some existing partners, a few new partners, and then -- a little bit surprising, a good number of our attendees today are not yet partners. So we hope you'll take this opportunity to understand more about the program and what it can really offer to builders in the marketplace. Alright, Sam, I'm going to hand it over to you. This is Sam Rashkin, chief architect of the Building Technologies Office and the program lead for DOE Zero Energy Ready Home.</p>
<p><em>Sam Rashkin:</em><br />OK, thank-you, Jamie.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And yea, it's great to have such a good mix. I'm glad we have some good review slides to kind of catch everyone up with the primary framework for this program. And it's best discussed under "Why Zero Energy Ready?"</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So what I want to do is first set up the new reality that every builder confronts in the marketplace, and that's that no matter whether they build a code home or above-code home, even with the least requirements by law, you're building a very much more efficient home. And that's because over time the energy code, after a very gradual ramp-up, has very steeply climbed, starting with the 2009 and 2012 IECC energy codes. And there you are with this new reality. And right on the other side are a bunch of risks and opportunities for differentiation we want to talk about that we think are directly linked to the Zero Energy Ready Home program. And so there we are, and even going further in the future, and I'll further emphasize those risks and differentiation opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So let's start with the risks.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Why there are significant risks, and in fact they come from one key driver. And what feeds that driver is that, again, we have more rigorous codes and an industry already moving very substantially to very low HERS Index scores. So the result is an advanced enclosure. So from a very basic building that we used to build, shown in this picture, we now have much more insulation, we have much better windows, and much, much more airtight construction. So let's build off this and look at three key risks that we face because of this new reality.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And starting with the advanced enclosure, we'll go to each individual risk. The first has to do with moisture. And of course, moisture is the No. 1 concern of homeowners, by far the most calls that the research center gets at the Housing Innovation Research Lab. The most calls they get from consumers addresses moisture concerns. And what happens when we have an advanced enclosure is the inside surface and the cavity on the cold side -- in cold climates that would be the outside sheathing; in hot climates that would be the sheetrock facing the cavity -- it's getting much colder. And that's because there's less thermal flow going through. And because there's less thermal flow, there's less drying. The wall cannot dry if it gets wet. So the risk that we're facing is more wetting potential while homes will have less drying that they can withstand, less tolerance for drying.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So we have to address this risk, and we do it with a comprehensive water protection system. So we have water-managed roofs, we want to have water-managed walls and openings, water- managed site and foundation details, and inside the home where water is present we want materials that are chosen carefully. Basically these are tried-and-true, proven measures. The key is not to just leave out one or two; that can get you into trouble. But to have a complete system of water protection.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Risk No. 2 has to deal again with the beginning of this advanced enclosure as a new reality, and it addresses whether we provide comfort with these advanced homes. And the outcome of an advanced enclosure is we have much, much reduced heating and cooling loads. And as a result, our heating and cooling systems have much less air flow going through the ducts. At the same time, we are starting the cooling much later in the year and the heating much later in the year, so we have longer swing seasons. And during those longer swing seasons, we have less humidity control. So we have to worry about relative humidity. And with the less air flow, we are running the risk of providing inadequate mixing, because up to now we've had very limited and often no attention paid to duct sizing, and to terminal design and whether there is adequate flow or adequate throw of the air into the room from the registers and how the registers are selected. So we need to address that risk with an optimized comfort system.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And the first thing we have to do is understand the loads and then right-size the equipment and/or use variable speed equipment that will enable the heating and cooling to meet the load requirements. Then we need the ducts inside the conditioned space. We can no longer tolerate running cooling through an oven, a hot, 150-degree attic anymore. Or running heated air through a freezing condition in the attic or crawl space or whatever it may be. And the other thing we need is proper installation. We need to know basic metrics are being followed that are specified by the manufacturer, and we need to test them and verify that the systems are installed correctly. And this is based on a long history of systems going in without that scrutiny.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And so the solution is that kind of optimized comfort system. The last risk is ensured indoor air quality. Again, starting with the advanced enclosure, we have much less air exchange with the tight construction, and contaminants can build up. So therefore, we have that risk that we have to manage. And the way we manage it is with a complete indoor air quality system, not a partial system. We don't leave out key pieces that can get us in trouble. So we start first with source control. We keep things out that can get us into trouble, sometimes radon, sometimes biological contaminants. And then we also build with materials that don't have lots of dangerous contaminants already built into them. And we also select equipment that doesn't introduce combustion byproducts. So we basically are managing the sources very carefully. The second part of a complete system is a fresh air system. Many of you will know of this as a ventilation system. And essentially it dilutes the residual contaminants that still wind up in our homes. And lastly, high-capture filtration in the form of a high-MERV filter in our heating and cooling system that can much more effectively capture particulates that are very, very high impact on health and homes. And so that's our complete indoor air quality system.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now moving on, we want to look at opportunities to also differentiate as the codes and HERS scores lower.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So here the first opportunity is to make homes that are future- ready. And what's really, really important is even with the advanced enclosure we have now we know where the next-generation codes are going. Let's say for example you have the 2009 IECC code; we know the 2012 is coming around the corner. So what we should do to give the consumer the best value is to optimize the enclosure. Give them the 2020 model car today in 2016. And the way we do that -- in doing that, what we wind up doing is having less obsolescence, because that home will not be obsolete in the near future, three or four years when the code jumps up, to in this case an example of 2012 IECC. And as energy costs continue to inflate, we have more future protection from those high costs. And very simply, we're going to ratchet up the insulation, the windows, and the air sealing to meet future code requirements. Have a whole-house thermal protection system that's ready for the future.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The next differentiation opportunity is to provide assured water protection. Again, we have optimized enclosure. We do the comprehensive water protection system we mentioned to manage risk, and we wind up with a house that delivers peace of mind. Again, I mention that the No. 1 consumer concern about durability with home ownership is with managing moisture problems. And with a house that has a complete water protection system, you are directly providing differentiation, addressing that concern.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The next differentiation opportunity is providing ultimate comfort, comfort that consumers really haven't yet seen, across the large realm of home ownership in this country. And what's happening is we've optimized our comfort system for low loads, and now we have something truly special. First, with the enclosure we're now doing something homes have hardly done up to now. We're managing the surface temperatures or the mean radiant temperature in our homes. When you walk in a home that has the surface temperatures under control, it's a completely different comfort experience. And also with the HVAC systems that are sized properly and managed humidity, we have air flow and RH under control. So this is a completely different comfort experience, and it protects the builder, as well, because homeowner complaints are much, much less likely when those factors are under control.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The fourth opportunity for differentiation, it gets back to the indoor air quality issue. We've come back with a comprehensive indoor air quality system. So these homes are truly health- ready. Now the homeowners themselves have lots of behavior that can affect the ultimate health performance of the home, but the builder has delivered a package that truly positions these homes to live in a much more healthful lifestyle for the homeowners. We will often hear stories in our experience talking to homeowners and builders about how in some cases the homeowner is able to throw away inhalers for their children because, again, the house lives much more healthy.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The last opportunity to talk about for differentiation or second to last is about technology, and the interest today in advanced technology in all facets of our lives. With the optimized enclosure and the ultra-low loads, now over half the remaining energy use in most homes will be attributed to all the things that go inside. So now we have energy-efficient components throughout the house, and the house is truly delivering better- quality products throughout the home, products that will often perform better and have better control capabilities. And so this is truly a tech-ready home for each and every home buyer.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And the last differentiation opportunity is back to zero. We have this whole foundation, again, of low loads and efficient equipment. All we need are low-cost or no-cost details that can make our homes ready for solar. And so there's minimal disruption or cost penalty in the future anytime buyers would want to install a solar system. And so your homes are zero ready, and this is particularly the case in the Zero Energy Ready Home program, for homes located in regions where there's a meaningful solar resource.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So looking at all this together, the risk plus differentiation factors contribute to our spec into how the whole platform for the requirements for Zero Energy Ready were developed. We start with the advanced enclosure, and it's an easy decision to optimize that enclosure and deliver the home of the future today. We know where homes are going. The next building block is a complete water protection system, again, for both risk protection and differentiation. The next building block is an optimized comfort system, again, to protect the risk of the builder. And add all the special differentiation and a whole different experience for home buyers. Then a complete indoor air quality system so the house is health-ready. Efficient components throughout the house so the house is tech-ready. And then the solar-ready construction so the house is zero-ready. This is in fact a home to the power of zero, and consumers can bank on this performance because it's a trusted label from the Department of Energy that verifies a home meets this level of excellence.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And the other great part about this is we now have a clear definition for what "zero" means. Often we hear concerns about green programs and initiatives, that there's not a clear definition. With Zero Energy Ready Home and this platform there's a very clear definition. It's a high-performance home so energy efficient, all or most annual energy consumption can be offset by renewable energy. And now what I'm going to do is change presenters and hand the slide deck back to Jamie.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Thanks, Sam. So Sam was taking us through sort of the why, why build Zero Energy Ready.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And I kind of reside in the technical realm of the Zero Energy Ready program. Which is great, because I look at that as the foundation. All the risk mitigation and value propositions and differentiation proposal that Sam mentioned really was built upon the specifications themselves. If we can't count upon the specs, which provide this differentiation, which provide that enhanced moisture protection, that comprehensive IAQ, then those value propositions are going to fall flat.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So we'll talk over the next few minutes about the specs themselves. There's a couple key takeaways, though. And we're going to do sort of the short version. But there's a couple key takeaways hopefully that will stick with you. First off, is that the specs themselves, they represent complete systems. So we're not going a la carte. We know we're doing all the things that make sense, for example, for a complete indoor air quality package for the home. So then all the value propositions about the healthful indoor environment, they all hold true. Same thing on water management and throughout the building. So they're complete systems, and they're also readily achievable and cost- effective today. We've given dozens and dozens of trainings on the specs to builders, raters, verifiers, architects, designers, and others. And you know, we'll often poll the crowd and say, you know, does anything up here seem really far out there, bleeding-edge of technology and adoption, and the answer is always no. These are good, better, best; we're normally in the better type range for what the expectations are for the building methods and the technologies, the readily achievable cost- effective. And the second piece on this slide is it's not a big jump to reach Zero Energy Ready. With a caveat: If you're starting at a code-minimum home, like you see on the right side, yea, it's going to be a big jump from code-minimum to DOE Zero Energy Ready. But we have a great launch point in the form of ENERGY STAR Homes. Our builder partners that find themselves in ENERGY STAR Homes territory are really some of our best candidates to come into the Zero Ready program, because they're 75, 80 percent of the way there. And that last step, which we'll talk about here in a minute, is pretty modest compared to the marketing and the differentiation and the risk management that they can take advantage of with DOE Zero Energy Ready. So definitely a modest step up from ENERGY STAR. We have that conversation with builders really on a regular basis.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So this is the slide we just looked at. It lays out the risk management advantages that these complete specs give, as well as the differentiation. And they're built, as Sam pointed out, on the six complete systems down at the bottom. So over the next six slides what I'd like to do is just describe to you what's inside each of these boxes, and sort of do so in a building- block type of way.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So the optimized enclosure that we talk about, that's driving a lot of the dynamics in the home right now. There's just a couple key pieces that that's built from. The first is the fact that DOE Zero Ready Homes are also ENERGY STAR version 3 qualified homes. So in terms of the enclosure, that gets us started. The thermal enclosure checklist contains good details for air barriers, thermal barrier alignment, limiting thermal bridging, things of that nature. On top of that, then, this is a home that's forward-looking. So the insulation levels are built to the 2012 or the 2015 IECC. You might wonder, well, why are there two codes there? States that have more advanced codes, that have adopted '12 or '15 already, they're held to the latest energy code which is published out there right now, which is the 2015 code. If a state is a little further back in adoption, maybe it's running on a 2009 IECC, then we would reference the 2012 code for the insulation levels. It's a little secretive, the fact that the insulation specs between 2012 and 2015 are pretty much identical. But we do maintain our spec such that if a state has more current codes, then we then require the most up-to-date published IECC in that state. And then the last piece of our optimized enclosure is the windows. We're trying to make these homes zero energy ready, so we're looking for the window package to be ENERGY STAR-rated windows. And we can get that with area- based weighted averages on the yield and solar heat gain across the whole glazing package, or we can get there with each window being ENERGY STAR-labeled. So there's some flexibility there. So that's it. That's the optimized enclosure system. Three building blocks.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Shifting over to the comfort. Same kind of thinking; we get a good start with the ENERGY STAR home as a prerequisite. In terms of comfort, ENERGY STAR Homes gives us a good load sizing for the HVAC, good duct design, so we know that the thermal distribution in the home is going to work. So that's where we get started. And then on top of that, we just add in really the optimized duct location. So again, we're trying to build these homes to reduce the loads. We don't want 55-degree air- conditioning air situated in an attic that's a 140 with nothing but RH between the two. We can do better than that. So the Zero Energy Ready Home program calls out seven or eight different design strategies for optimizing the duct locations. And then if we're in a hot-humid region, the optimized comfort also calls for enhanced RH control in those parts of the country. So that's the optimized comfort. There's two building blocks.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />In terms of the indoor air quality system, again, ENERGY STAR Homes gives us a good benchmark, the starting point. It requires things like whole-house ventilation, local exhaust to remove pollutants, things of that type. And beyond that, we're pretty lucky. There's a great off-the-shelf product that's the EPA Indoor airPLUS program, which really just rounds out all the other things you want to do to have a complete good indoor air quality system for the home. So we know that we're doing all the things that it makes sense to do. So we list radon there. If a home is in radon Zone 1 based on the EPA maps, then the home's going to have passive radon mitigation built in. We have low emission materials, so these homes, which are generally pretty well air-sealed, we'll make sure that they're not being sourced with high concentrations of formaldehyde or VOCs from things like cabinets and carpeting. Products which are out there in the marketplace, they're easy to find, but now we're just being very intentional about specifying them. Things like combustion safety and higher filtrations, MERV-8 filtrations. So for those of you familiar with the filtration and MERV ratings, 8, that's a good filter. It's not the highest, most-expensive technology in the market, but it's good. So that's all part of our IAQ complete system.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Water protection, same thing. Building block, we start with ENERGY STAR Homes. And then we do a few other measures, which again are spelled out within the Indoor airPLUS program. Things like the use of sump pumps, using appropriate foaming materials in wet areas, putting gravel or (inaudible) beneath the slab. All those other things that give us complete water protection system.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Efficient components. We're going to see a number of readily available products here flying in on your left side there, the appliances. They're things like the dishwasher, ENERGY STAR- rated. If the builder supplies the clothes washer, same thing. ENERGY STAR-rated exhaust fans. So they'll use a little bit less energy, and as a bonus, they're quiet. So people might use them more frequently. Ceiling fans. We look for 80 percent of the lighting to be ENERGY STAR-rated fixtures or bulbs. And then the water heater itself; we look for its efficiency to be right on par with an ENERGY STAR water heater. And you notice it says "target" there. The rub there is that we don't have a requirement for an ENERGY STAR water heater, but the HERS Index that the home is modeled against assumes in the reference home, that reference home is an ENERGY STAR level of water heater. So we're compared against that basis. And then there's one other key item here on the efficient component side. It's the efficient hot water distribution. Again, here we didn't have to reinvent something. We simply looked to the WaterSense program, which is a comprehensive water program out of EPA. They have a good spec for what determines if the hot water distribution system in a home is efficient or not. So we migrate to that, and we add that provision to sort of round out our whole package for efficient components in the home.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then last but not least, solar-readiness. These are Zero Energy Ready Homes. Sam mentioned low-cost / no-cost items that can really set up the home to more easily, economically add PV in the future if that's in the cards. So there's a solar PV ready checklist that's part of our spec. It's seven, eight provisions, things like let's hand over the load ratings for the roof framing to the homeowner because we have them from our truss manufacturer. Let's hand over those ratings so they have them in hand in the future, should they need them to evaluate their roof loads. Let's put a capped conduit from the attic area down to the electric service panel area so it's easier to run wires inside the home at some point in the future, should we need to do so, to tie in the panels. Things like that. So those are the building blocks.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So I like to say if a builder or their designer, their rater partners, if they know ENERGY STAR Homes they know 75 percent of our spec. If they know ENERGY STAR Homes and they know the Indoor airPLUS program that we mentioned, they probably know 85, 90 percent of our spec. There's just a couple additional measures beyond that, things like the efficient hot water distribution, which are very easy to pick up on. We'll talk about some of our resources on those in a minute. The framework for the specs: This is the front page of our national specs document. We have our mandatory items. These are things that are must-haves, things like we want comprehensive IAQ, we need an efficient hot water distribution system. These are must-haves. And then the target home I mentioned a minute ago, this thing called a reference home. When we model the home in REM/Rate, we model the home in Energy Gauge, in the background that rating software creates a twin of our house, and it compares the efficiency of our design home versus this reference home. The reference home is dialed in to these specifications -- it's kind of small to see here, but it sets the bar for how efficient the reference home should be. We just need a HERS rating at the end of that modeling process that meets or exceeds the target home's HERS rating. So we can trade off against any of these specs as long as the HERS rating for the home meets or exceeds the target home. And then lastly, just like the ENERGY STAR Homes program, there's a size adjustment factor. So if a home is extremely large compared to these benchmark home sizes, the HERS threshold, the HERS target that we need to hit, it's ratcheted down a little bit. And the larger the design home is, the more of a reduction we'll see in that HERS target. We see this come out from time to time, it's a home that's just a little bit over the benchmark home size. The HERS target for the project might drop by 1 or 2 points. If it's very, very large it'll drop by more than that. So that's the exact same as the construction that's set up by ENERGY STAR Homes.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So we mentioned the HERS target. People looking at the program, and understanding where they are relative to complying with DOE Zero Energy Ready, will often ask about the HERS Index. Where do you typically have to score on the HERS scale for a home to qualify in terms of its energy efficiency? So on this chart here, we have seven climate zones, 1 through 7. We model a few different homes of different sizes on foundation types, which kind of fit the climate zone that we are looking at. And you can see that homes generally start to qualify for the Zero Energy Ready program somewhere in the mid-50s, lower 50s in some cases, and this will vary by the site. But it gives our partners a feel for, OK, I build HERS of in the upper 50s, or low 60s, how far am I from meeting the efficiency target for DOE Zero Energy Ready? So this gives you an idea of the answer to that. And then we always keep an eye on what the RESNET values are each year, when they do their annual reporting. So this past year, 2015, 190,000 homes received a HERS rating throughout the country. The average is a 62. So that tells us that there's tens of thousands of homes which are going to be somewhere in this vicinity of the 50s or lower. So those homes as well as ENERGY STAR Homes are really, really ideal candidates for the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program because they've done most of the lift already.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So that's our quick walk through the specs. We will, in the session after this one, cover some of the technical resources, resources many of which are a deeper dive into the specs, and give some guidance on designs and technologies to meet the specs. But in the meantime, I'm going to hand it right back over to Sam Rashkin here, to talk us through what are the marketing resources available to our partners.</p>
<p><em>Sam Rashkin:</em><br />Hey, thanks, Jamie. And I'm back.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And let's talk about those marketing resources and why / how they translate value. Because ultimately you have a very robust set of specifications and performance metrics that you're meeting, but how does that get translated so the consumer really understands and appreciates that value. That's the trick.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So let's frame this whole challenge graphically. Let's say, here's a minimum-code home. And what we're really doing with a Zero Energy Ready house is we're going to take it about halfway down. We're going to be 50 percent more efficient than a code, and we'll get there with these optimized enclosure, efficient components, a solar-ready construction. And on top of that, we're going to make it really risk-managed, with moisture protection, optimized comfort, and comprehensive indoor air quality. If we do all that, then we earn this Zero Energy Ready Home label. And it's up to the builder and the homeowner when and if they want to add the solar system or have some other offsets that they purchase for renewable energy now or in the future. And by doing that, they'll get most or all of the annual consumption down to zero. There are reasons why it may be more than zero some years. It could be weather; it could be factors that deal with utility charges, or buying power. It could be just the use of a homeowner: lots of occupants or lots of high energy-using equipment like swimming pools and so forth. So there will be a lot of factors that have to frame this brand promise. But that's what we're doing. And as you can imagine, that's a complicated story for our consumer. So we have to figure solutions for our partners so we can be really effective engaging that buyer. And that's what we want to talk about now.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So the first and foremost way that we're going to get to the buyer is with a national campaign to inform consumers by working with our manufacturing partners and other groups that promote high-performance homes to get consumers to look at a consumer video. And the key thing about this video is it really has to nail down a core message that really resonates. And it was really interesting for our team to kind of figure out what was that core message. And at the end of the day, it wasn't about green. It wasn't about environmental performance or comfort or health. The single core that was most relevant from our perspective was that the Zero Energy Ready Home is truly the experts' choice.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />When we poll hundreds and hundreds of experts -- architects, engineers, building science / forensic people, our researchers -- everyone that truly represents the most-informed potential home buyer we could identify, and we asked them, side by side by side, three identical homes, would you buy a code home, an ENERGY STAR Home for a few thousand more, or a Zero Energy Ready Home for $5,000 to $6,000, $7,000 more, which would you buy? And virtually almost 100 percent of the responses are, they would buy the Zero Energy Ready Home. More to the point of this expert guidance is a Zero Energy Ready Home is based on the hub of innovation, if you will, of our Department of Energy Building America program. We've had up to 10 different teams working together, four national labs. The contents of this specification are so much driven by the best practices identified by that expertise. This is truly a home that's the experts' choice. Think if you had an Uncle Max, who is the best darn car mechanic you knew ever, and you were about to buy a car. And Uncle Max gave you this recommendation to buy this specific car. You would have so much confidence and peace of mind before making such a big purchase. Well, that's what we're doing with the Zero Energy Ready Home.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Let's run you through the message of the consumer video. So yes, the home is often the largest purchase of a lifetime. And not only that -- it's often either cost-prohibitive or impossible to make changes once it's built, the changes that can truly transform how the home functions. And that's why it's such an overwhelming decision for home buyers, and that's why they worry about lots of their outcomes after they buy the home. Particularly outcomes that deal with the things they can see, moisture and the energy bills, and that deal with the comfort and deal with the resale value of the home. At the end of the day, now, with Zero Energy Ready Home, we can deliver a home on the performance side that reflects the best expert guidance, the home the experts and performance experts would choose for themselves. And it's because of seven must-have systems that every expert would want to have in each and every home they would buy. And the first system is that optimized thermal protection system. They don't want just the minimal, by-law requirements for walls and roofs and foundations and walls. They want a home that meets or exceeds where housing has to go, where the future codes are pointing. They want what the experts know, a home that's future-ready, to protect their time in the home and to protect their resale in the future. And every expert wants whole-house water protection. They know that moisture is the No. 1 concern, and they know that you cannot do that in pieces. They want a house that's moisture-ready. And every expert would want a high-performance heating and cooling system. They know that comfort systems aren't installed today commonly the way they need to be. They aren't as efficient as they can be. And they don't have many of the details that make them work best. And so they would insist on a comfort-ready system. And every expert would want high-efficiency components throughout the house, because the experts know that these components aren't just efficient, that they often work better. And they often have better operational characteristics. They want a home that's truly tech-ready. They know how powerful technology is. And every expert would want a home that has complete indoor air quality. They know that the indoor environment has two to five times more contaminants than the outdoor environment. They know that you need a complete system. They want a house that's health-ready. And every expert would want solar-ready construction. They know it takes simple details to prepare their house for the future. So anytime they would want they can add a solar system and truly have a house that's zero ready. And lastly, experts want ensured quality assurance. They would never want to just rely on just having the home built without knowing that there was independent verification: testing, inspection, checklist, and certifications that demonstrate the largest purchase of a lifetime was held accountable to some of the best standards in the country. Every one of these systems an expert would have. And one of the reasons the experts would ask for this is they know that the true cost of a home is not the sticker price. The sticker price is the value, and they want a home with higher value, but they know that higher-value home may have a slightly higher mortgage, but when you add in the utility savings every month, that often that can be the lowest cost option to buy as well as delivering all those benefits that they want. And the experts know you can get that by simply looking for a label that makes sure the consumer gets all of those value propositions. The Zero Energy Ready Home label. And they know how to get you the information you need so you can find a builder. Simply go to this website and get this information. So this is our consumer message. And we think this is a compelling message. Truly no one wants to get a sub-optimal product when you're buying such a large purchase. And so this video will be posted on our website, on our Tour of Zero. We'll talk more about that in a minute. And this is a video that we're going to have as many manufacturers as we can get on our side to form a national campaign to inform the home buyer.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />OK, next point: We need to translate value with clarity. And clarity, you will find, depends on contrast. We understand things so much better when we see it compared to something else, not when it's in isolation. And that drives so much of how we've developed our marketing resources for you, the builder partner.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And it begins with a set of comparison bars. And we've identified six key value propositions, and those are health, comfort, technology, efficiency, quality and durability. And what we did is create bars that graphically show with a glance the comparison between the main competitive forces that we're managing, whether you should buy a DOE Zero Energy Ready Home, an ENERGY STAR-certified home, or an existing home.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Let's say we looked at health by example. You can see in this simple graph at a glance that the Zero Energy Ready Home has all the recommendations by the leading expert authority on health in our country, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, whereas the ENERGY STAR-qualified home has about half those recommendations, and the existing home has hardly any. And the reason we know is because we meet all of the requirements of the EPA Indoor airPLUS label. And it's such a simple message when you have the comparison and the contrast. Do you want all the recommendations, half or hardly any? If we simply said our house has more health, I as a consumer don't know what to do with that message. But when I see in contrast I have to give up half the recommendations by a leading expert on health, that's a much more simple message. And what we do is we integrate it into all of our materials. But first we have to back it up.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And we have full transparency. How those bars were graphically or quantitatively developed is in this study that's on our website.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then you'll see these bars on fact sheets, like this, that can be customized with the builder's name and contact information. They're used, and there again, "Health" would be circled if I was talking to a prospective home buyer who really cared about the health of their children who are using inhalers.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then we use the same comparison bars on our brochures that can be customized with the builder's logo and contact information. Again, if I met a buyer who cared about health, I'd take out that big thick marker and I'd circle the health benefit. If they care about technology, I'd circle "Technology." If they care about low utility bills, I'd circle "Efficient." Now, if I have a buyer who really cares about the fact that they're really nervous buying their first home and they don't know if it's a choice they can trust, I'd take out that marker and I'd circle "The Future of Housing Today," because this says you can trust this choice. Only a select group of top builders in the country meet these extraordinary guidelines by the U.S. Department of Energy, a trusted government authority. So a very powerful contrast applied to all of our marketing resources that you can customize.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Second thing we do is we translate with power words. We know that consumers don't want to hear jargon. They want to hear about experiences that will make their lives better. We've developed a whole library of terminology about how to frame everything we do in a high-performance home so it speaks to the consumer experience.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then what we've done is we've applied it into a sales tool we'll mention a little bit later when Jamie talks about the technical resources, the Building America Solution Center.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />But what you need to know in the limited time we have today is that you can go to the sales tool and in virtually a minute or less create customized fact sheets about your products that list the innovations relative to the value propositions your buyers will care about. So if you have a buyer who cares about health, you can have a healthful environment fact sheet customized to your company, and you have a full list of 30, 40 innovations that include all the health recommendations by the leading expert in our nation. So you can give it to your buyer: Here's why our home is so much more healthy; it has all these innovations. So again, the use. And all these innovations are framed in power words. So the ventilation system is a fresh-air system, and so forth.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The other thing we do is translate with trust. We know that consumers don't trust a lot of the products they buy and the sources they come from, not because they're bad; they're just not informed. And if you're not informed, you don't know what you're buying. This study suggests 1 in 3 don't trust the building and real estate companies. I would think it's much higher, but I'll let everyone make their own choice in that. But let's just indicate that we have a solution for trust.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now, we're not like a typical brand that's very common and highly invested with resources to build knowledge about that brand. But we are a government-backed label that people trust, because we are the Department of Energy.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And this is a label that every partner is empowered to use if they meet our guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And essentially, here's one example where you can see, this label in front of a home truly makes that home stand out. And now, we would say the trust factors go up a whole notch, because it's leveraging the Department of Energy label.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And just think about how many labels you can use because you are Zero Energy Ready Home. You of course meet the Zero Energy Ready Home certification, but you also meet the Indoor airPLUS, the ENERGY STAR, and this builder also met the NAHB Green Builder guidelines. So now your home will start to really be distinguished with a lot of trust because you are meeting so many government-backed labels for excellence that are attached to your house.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And we also translate with trust because there's a certificate that comes with each home that's rated and verified as Zero Energy Ready Home straight from the software that you use for HERS ratings.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />You also get trust because you're listed on a DOE website, not just on your own website, as a special builder, one of the select builders in the country that can meet these guidelines for excellence. And the partner locator tool basically is a way for consumers to find this kind of excellence. They simply highlight a state or search by other means to find builders.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And it links them to leading-edge builders, with your contact information, website links, whether you've won awards from us, and the number of homes that you've certified. And so this would be the example of the page that a consumer would come to, and it has all this information and a way to find you, a leading-edge builder in our nation.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And the last part about trust is we provide builders with drop- in messaging, because we often hear that builders feel constrained by what they can and can't say on many of these attributes due to sometimes liability concerns. But we know objectively what you've done to your homes, and we frame those objective accomplishments in a whole array of statements that speak to your excellence.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So as an example here's one builder, Garbett Homes. They highlight some text, "According to DOE our homes are the homes of the future because they meet or exceed next-generation energy codes and include substantial innovations and best practices." So now you have this way to drop-in messaging that's not just using you're meeting this kind of excellence, but it's from the Department of Energy. More trust.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then there's recognition that helps translate your value, recognition that you're doing something truly special. And one of the most important things that we encourage all of our partners to do is to do the Housing Innovation Awards.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Every year those applications and homes that do an excellent job meeting our guidelines are recognized. So your website may change from simply just this with the Housing Innovation Awardto this. You're recognized as a leader, you're featured prominently, and it's truly a distinguished recognition for your company.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And you can use it with your consumer-facing settings; you can have banners and other ways of identifying that kind of leadership that you've achieved.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now, the reason this Housing Innovation Award is so important is when you are recognized by the Innovation Award, you're then placed onto the Tour of Zero. This is a way for consumers to see a completely different homeowner experience in this home's both list level of excellence.</p>
<p><em>Next several slides:</em><br />They simply highlight an area of interest in the country, or they can search by any other types of names, builders. So they select a location; a list of builders will appear. They can hit a link to any home of interest. And then they get a whole tour of that home. It starts with the images. We then go through inside and outside the home. And then they can also get the experiential information, the testimonial about why the house is better. "Now that we've lived in that Zero Energy Ready Home, we couldn't imagine living anywhere else." And then they get information about the statistics: the square footage, the HERS Index. In this case, that this home saves almost $100,000 over a 30-year mortgage because of lower cost of ownership. They can see the special features using the power words, not the jargon, about why that home is special. They can then go to, if they read more, the full report about that specific home. A profile is prepared for every home that wins the Housing Innovation Award. And if they want to see the floor plan, they click on "More," can see the floorplan. And then they finally realize they want one; they click on "I want one!" That goes to the locator page for that specific builder who built that home that they are touring. So the Tour of Zero is an amazing way for consumers to walk and feel the difference about homes built to this next level.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And you'll see our builders use this recognition so effectively, like in this case Addison Homes. They blog about their presence on the Tour of Zero, and they wound up being one of the most toured homes on the Tour of Zero. So you can leverage your presence yourself by how you leverage social media and other means of communicating with your prospective buyers.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />The big thing here is that there will be a national campaign asking consumers that they owe it to themselves to visit the home of the future that they can buy today. And we'll bring in all these concomitant interests: manufacturers' associations, NGOs, financial institutions, that help us post this button. They can have consumers be a link away from taking that tour.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And now, I'm going to hand it back to Jamie to talk about the technical resources.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Thank-you, Sam. Let me get that queued up. OK. So technical resources; we mentioned them a few minutes ago. We sort of queued this up as "compliance made easy."</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Over the next couple slides we'll cover what resources are available to our partners to help them navigate the technical requirements cost-effectively and efficiently. So square 1 is really just the program requirements. If you visit the main page for the Zero Ready program -- we'll list that website at the end -- there's a left-hand menu, and program requirements is right there. It's a PDF document. We looked at that one table earlier. It basically has the main program requirements. There are some footnotes and endnotes there that provide additional detail. They may or may not be relevant to you and your projects, but they're worth taking a look at, especially if you have a question about how to comply with a particular provision, like locating ducts in an optimized location. Something like that. So that's square 1, where to find the program requirements.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />In following that path, some of our partners are already really doing these things, so there's no learning curve. Others want to look around for other methods, technologies, techniques. And we love to have those conversations, and we like to describe all the options available to our partners as a toolkit. Toolkit for HVAC design, toolkit for hot water distribution, and so forth. In that spirit, we've been running a series of technical training webinars, which offer a deeper dive. Typically these are about an hour. We'll have an industry expert drill into a topic. We frame it, not just let's talk about high-R envelopes; we talk about getting enclosures right in the Zero Energy Ready Homes. That was a webinar we ran earlier this year, with Joe Lstiburek of Building Science. Along that same line, there's a low-load HVAC design and tips session in Zero Energy Ready Homes, with Greg Cobb of iEngineering, earlier this year. LED lighting design and efficiency, ducts in conditioned space. This list as you see here is just a sample. If you go to our website and click under resources, there's a whole menu of these webinars that we recorded, obviously, and then we continue to give them on a live basis. These can be very valuable for our partners looking to gain some insights on how to move forward.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />In that same thinking, I like to point out -- Sam just talked about the Tour of Zero. These case studies are great. Much of the Tour of Zero is very consumer-facing, visual, a higher level of information. But there are the case studies, if you want to drill down a little bit further, and they're also highlighted here on our main website. Typically it's a two- or three-page PDF, which drills down a bit further into the specs and systems used in the home. So when I'm talking to builders and developers about what's involved in the program, what do the homes look and feel like, I'll often point them to these. Because you can sort out by climate region -- you know, I'm building in the hot-humid climate; what do these homes typically look like? What are they doing for cooling? What are they doing for dehumidification? So you can drill down in these case studies and just gain some insights that way.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then there's the Building America Solution Center, really a fantastic resource. We see more and more usage of this. The thing I'd like to highlight here: Sam mentioned the sales tool. We can provide sales sheets and speak to the consumer experience and get away from jargon. That's fantastic. In terms of a technical resource. I like to point out these program checklists. There's tons of content within the Solution Center that speaks to building science, savvy design, of all the parts of the home. We can navigate with the Zero Energy Ready checklist. I will click here. I can navigate all the content within the Solution Center through the lens of Zero Energy Ready Home. So I click that checklist navigator and then I can drill down further in the mandatory requirements. I can talk, look to the target home. Just in this example, I click on the mandatory requirements. Again, I'm still in the sort of the checklist frame here. And then I drill down into the duct system, and the requirements for Zero Energy Ready Home regarding ducts is that ducts are located within the home's thermal and air barrier boundary. So now I click on that, and it opens up this sort of door to the Solution Center, and all the content within the Solution Center is presented to me that deals with locating ducts in this optimized location. So then I can click on a measure guideline and other resources on all these different design strategies under this topic. So I clicked on the first one there, and voila, I have a page with the scope and CAD details, right-versus-wrong pictures, training, all these different tabs that open up, that tell me about this design for ducts that are buried and encapsulated with spray foam and buried under the attic insulation. So just a few clicks, I've gone from the checklist view of DOE Zero Ready Home to really good design guidance on how I can proceed with my duct design strategy. Just one quick example. It's a really nice resource. Just test-drive it, if you haven't done it.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Pick a building system and just take a test-drive to see what's in there so you're familiar and you can go back when you need to. Also with zero ready compliance, we've worked hard to integrate compliance reporting with the rating software that's out there, REM/Rate and Energy Gauge. They both automatically program that target home that I mentioned. So that's automatically done in the software. And what it's doing is comparing the HERS rating of that target home to my actual project. And I need a HERS rating that comes in at or below the target home's HERS rating. That's all done automatically by the compliance software. And here, the software also includes checkboxes for the mandatory items. So if the project includes all the Indoor airPLUS specs that are spelled out in the checklist, then I would check that box. If my ducts are located in an optimized location based on what's allowed in our spec, I would check that box. And so on. That's the look and feel of the software integration. Makes it very easy to evaluate a project, to see where it stands with Zero Energy Ready.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />On that note, there's a little quick analysis button in REM/Rate; Energy Gauge has something similar. So if you have an energy model for a project that's a low HERS score, or maybe it's an ENERGY STAR home, it takes really just a couple minutes to assess it and say, OK, where is it falling with respect to Zero Energy Ready Home compliance? We also like to point out that most homes that are meeting Zero Energy Ready are in that neighborhood where they're going to pass the federal tax credit in most cases, as well, while that credit's still available.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Software integration. Continued the compliance software; it gives a report. And it says yes, this project complies, or in some cases it may not comply. But what I like about that is the compliance report gives some feedback. It might be that the HERS score needs to be a little bit lower. It might be that the building envelope isn't meeting the 2012 insulation levels. Or it might tell us that the mandatory checkboxes haven't been selected, so we need to look at that. So it gives you some feedback, and in some cases, we'll have builders really -- they want to meet Zero Energy Ready Home, but they want to meet it sort of right on the dot. So they'll optimize compliance. They'll tinker with their design and their specs. So the home is just complying. So it can provide a lot of valuable feedback. And again, this is just the report that's run by the rating software. I'm getting a little flag here that we're running tight on time. We'll try to hustle up here and wrap this up in the next 10 minutes or so.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />If you are pressed on time, we certainly understand that. You can come back and listen to the end of the recording, if that's a better option for you. Compliance made easy. How do we go about verifying homes? Again, big first step is the ENERGY STAR Homes rating and field verification process. We're going through that. The things that are new. The builder and / or rater need to verify the Indoor airPLUS checklist. That's things like making sure that the cabinetry meets one of the specs that we reference for low formaldehyde, things of that nature. PV-ready checklist, again, there's about a half-dozen provisions there that need to be field-verified. And then the last item is that hot water distribution test so we can confirm in the field that within a short amount of time of calling for hot water the hot water arrives at the furthest fixture. I should also note that these additional items typically will fit into the two-visit type model that many verifiers employ with your builder clients. And then for submitting qualifying projects, they go to this email address. There's that report that we talked about, that's generated by the rating software. It's wrapped up in a PDF, and it's sent to this email address. This allows builders to gain credit and so their count of qualified homes on the DOE website is updated. Many of you are probably familiar with the RESNET buildings registry. We're migrating submission of qualified projects to the registry later on this year. You'll hear more about that.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then lastly, partner support in general, across admin, process of submitting homes, marketing, technical. There's a staff with several of us here. One of us is typically always available to field questions via phone, via email, and of course the program website listed there, as well.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Alright, home stretch. I'm going to hand it back to Sam here quickly to discuss best ways and tips for leveraging your partnership once you're signed up for the program. All yours, Sam.</p>
<p><em>Sam Rashkin:</em><br />Hey thanks, Jamie. This is truly the home stretch, and this will be our shortest module, Leveraging Your Partnership. Because it's going to basically speak to, once you're a partner, it's time to use the assets of the home's program or the Zero Energy Ready provides.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So the first thing is you have to become a partner. And it's very simply done through our website, electronically. You're basically committing to follow the guidelines, not label a home that doesn't meet the guidelines, and then you can use our brand as a qualified partner. You have to have certified a home one per year to remain active If you don't, you will be simply noted as inactive until such time as you submit a home in the future beyond that time. There's no cost for being a partner. This is free for you except for the costs you incur to verify your home so it can be certified. And in many categories, for partners, primarily in this orientation we're speaking to builders, but verifiers can also be partners. Architects and designers. And then we have innovation partners who will be helping us promote the Tour of Zero and the video that we showed you earlier. And over the next year or so we're hoping to engage lenders. And we do have training partners who provide various training programs on the program.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Now the key point we want to make to partners is we've really worked hard. We're road-tested the resources we've developed. And they have such high marks for how effective they are. So it's up to you, once you're a partner, to use them.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And you simply go to the resources part of the web page, and you get access to a whole array of resources that we talked about. I want to highlight the fact that for you, the partner, there are special resources that are only accessed with your special password that you get as a partner. And those are the resources primarily that you are using to be customized, to put your name and contact and logo information on the resources. But you want to develop these customized resources. It's not just using your special -- it's also of the Department of the Energy, but we need you to be a partner and to use this portion of the website to make that happen.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Next thing I want to mention is you really should leverage the brand. We hear over and over again how effective the Department of Energy is in engaging consumer trust and confidence. And all partners, again, receive access to a partner-branded logo that you're a partner, and also to the web button that will allow you to provide linkage to our Tour of Zero and the video. Very important. And of course, you get the basic Zero Energy Ready Home logo that you can use for marketing that your home meets the guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Then we also want you to make sure you do customize the resources with your names and logo information on them. So here's the bottom half of the fact sheet. But again, you have to go into the resources page and use your partner password so you can have very simply executed customization options for these materials.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Also, to get on the Tour, you have to submit applications for the Housing Innovation Awards. It's a simple process. We have a very organized application form that's built on a spreadsheet entry concept. But you will find that we provide lots of recognition. And once you're recognized, you're placed automatically onto the Tour of Zero. So do take advantage of the Housing Innovation Awards for the recognition. Just the leadership distinction provided by the award gives you and also for placement on the Tour of Zero.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And then, again, leverage the Department of Energy as a trusted voice of authority with the drop-in messaging. It's perfect for your website, your social media, for your press releases and fliers. It doesn't happen unless you take advantage of this resource.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />Also, recognize that you'll have increased visibility, not just on your own website but you'll be appearing on the DOE website as a partner. And if you provide your URL, you will have the linkage directly to your website from ours. So do take advantage of providing us with your URL when you become a partner, and do recognize that this is a really important part of being featured in an unbiased source of information that you're a Zero Energy Ready Home partner.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And do leverage the consumer message. I think it's a very powerful message about why you're building a better product. The consumer video will be posted in another month, we expect, and we also plan on taking that same message, customizing it for a homeowner manual, again, can be customized for you. And it will have along with that a value message that helps educate your buyers about how they got such a special home and makes them a better sales force for giving you further referrals. It also basically will have important tips about how they can own their home and how they can maintain their home for best performance, which again will reflect better on you, the builder.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />And lastly, document your excellence. Make sure your homeowners get the certificate that their home is in fact certified Zero Energy Ready. And provide each and every home buyer with a certificate.</p>
<p><em>Next slide:</em><br />So that brings us to the end. You have completed the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home orientation training course. We hope it helped address a lot of the main questions you'll have as a partner. How to get the most from the program. But there always will be other questions and areas of interest you have, so for more information you have this website linkage and the email address to contact us to have questions answered. We keep innovating our resources and our solutions. So always do keep coming to the website to see what's new, what else we have. Also as a partner you'll be getting a newsletter on a regular basis that informs you about a lot of the innovations in the program. And we might highlight some upcoming events. In August we'll have another webinar on the program specifications. Coming up in September, we'll have an efficient hot water distribution webinar. And the Housing Innovation Awards will be happening at the EEBA conference, the Energy and Environmental Building Alliance conference, and that will be in Dallas this year. So all these things are coming along. Thank-you so much for spending a few extra minutes with us and for attending this orientation. I'll hand it back to Alex.</p>
<p><em>Jamie Lyons:</em><br />Alex might be on mute, Sam, so this is Jamie. To reiterate Sam's thank-you, thank-you, everybody, for taking part in the webinar today. You have all the program resources. If you would like to submit a question via the email we listed, please do so. Sorry we couldn't have more time to get to the questions during the session. Thank-you for joining us today.</p>
