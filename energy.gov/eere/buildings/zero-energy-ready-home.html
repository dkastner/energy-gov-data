<p>Since 2013, the<a href="https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/housing-innovation-awards"> Housing Innovation Awards</a> have recognized the very best in innovation on the path to Zero Energy Ready Homes.  This year's awards ceremony will be held at the <a href="https://energy.gov/exit?url=http%3A//www.eeba.org/conference" rel="nofollow">EEBA Excellence in Building Conference &amp; Expo</a>, September 27-29 in Frisco, Texas.</p>
<p>You can view all the past Housing Innovation Award winners on the <a href="https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/doe-tour-zero">Tour of Zero</a>. These builders are changing the way homes are designed and constructed, providing better places for Americans to live, stronger communities, and a more economically and environmentally resilient nation. </p>
