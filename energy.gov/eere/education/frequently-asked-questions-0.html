<p><strong><a id="does_a_fellow_earn_vacation_of_sick_leave_during_the_appointment">Does a Participant earn vacation of sick leave during the appointment</a>?</strong><br />Participants are not employees; therefore, there are no employment-related benefits such as paid vacations, sick leave, or unemployment compensation. With the approval of the research mentor, however, a Participant may be excused from participation for brief periods due to personal leave, illness, emergencies, or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Participants will be expected to maintain a full-time schedule during the appointment except for normal holidays recognized by the host facility and approved by the research mentor.</p>
<p>If a Participant needs to be off for any extended period of time and cannot make up the time, then the research mentor will notify ORISE and the participant will be put on leave-without-pay status until he/she returns.</p>

<h4>Taxes</h4>
<p><a id="does_orau_orise_withhold_federal_and_state_income_taxes_for_fellows"><strong>Does ORAU/ORISE withhold federal and state income taxes for </strong></a><strong>Participants?</strong><br />No. Since Participants are not employees and since they receive awards (not wages), ORAU/ORISE does not withhold state or federal income taxes from award payments for U.S. citizens. Participants should consider filing Form 1040-ES on a quarterly basis and paying estimated federal income taxes in order to avoid late payment penalties. Travel expense reimbursements (including relocation costs) are not taxable.</p>
<p>Participants should consult a tax accountant or other tax professional regarding state and federal income tax requirements.</p>
<p>EERE Participants receive award payments from ORAU, which are reported to the IRS as Miscellaneous Income- prizes and awards as defined in IRS Code Section 74. All payments by ORAU/ORISE should be reported on the Participant's federal income tax return, form 1040, as "Other Income" and be identified as a "Fellowship Award."</p>
<p><strong><a id="are_eere_fellows_exempt_from_paying_self_employment_taxes">Are EERE Participants exempt from paying self-employment taxes</a>?</strong><br />Yes. Since EERE Participants are not employees and since they receive awards (not wages), they are exempt from paying Social Security and Medicare taxes.</p>
