<h4 id="waterorg">Water Conservation Awards to Organizations</h4>
<p><em>Environmental Protection Agency<br />Research Triangle Park Main Laboratory</em><br />Research Triangle Park, North Carolina</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Research Triangle Park (RTP) facility saved 8.1 million gallons of water in fiscal year 2008, equal to 82% of EPA's total water savings accomplished in that year. EPA implemented several initiatives, including switching from single-pass cooling to use of re-circulated chilled water to cool equipment, retrofitting lavatory faucets and pre-rinse spray valves, optimizing schedules for washing animal cages and racks, turning off two inefficient two-cell cooling towers, retrofitting facilities steam sterilizers controls, and reducing water supplied to a central laboratory vacuum system by two-thirds. These measures reduced facility water consumption in fiscal year 2008 by 15.3% from the previous year and avoided $70,000 in water costs. The projects also contributed in part to the Research Triangle Park's facility-wide savings of more than 50 billion Btu and more than $457,000 in energy cost savings from fiscal year 2007.</p>
<p><em>U.S. Marine Corps<br />Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</em><br />San Diego, California</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar conserved water in three primary areas to achieve cost savings of more than $371,000. Miramar completed three additional phases of its reclaimed water project, using reclaimed water for large landscaping areas as well as for dual piping of toilets and urinals for new facilities. The station also installed a state-of-the-art central irrigation control system, which monitors and manages all of the potable and reclaimed irrigation lines. A major benefit of this system is the automatic shut off of any line that indicates water loss, such as a broken line or valve. Four athletic fields have been renovated with artificial turf, lowering both water and maintenance costs. Together, these efforts saved more than 21.5 million gallons in fiscal year 2008, reducing Miramar's potable water consumption by about 15% from the previous year and 18% below the fiscal year 2007 baseline.</p>
<h4 id="watergrp">Water Conservation Awards to Small Groups</h4>
<p><em>Richard Anderson<br />Victor Hammond<br />Jon Hayden<br />Joshua Jones<br />Russ Smalling<br />Department of the Army<br />Tooele Army Depot</em><br />Tooele, Utah</p>
<p>When Tooele Army Depot's water use skyrocketed in early fiscal year 2008, the team suspected broken water lines were causing water loss and worked to find an effective method to identify the problem areas. The team researched and initiated the use of subsurface leak detection equipment, which amplifies the sound of a water leak, allowing the operator to detect its precise location. The Team made a series of sound-level measurements that resulted in discovery of 12 water line breaks that were all repaired during fiscal year 2008. In the last two quarters of fiscal year 2008 alone, the base saved 12 million gallons of water and almost $5,000. Considering the cost of the equipment and repairs, payback is estimated at 2.6 years. Tooele Army Depot shared its success story with all Army organizations through a 2008 Army publication on energy efficiency lessons learned.</p>
<p><em>John Bollinger<br />Michael Hatch<br />Robert Hellmuth<br />Todd Snouffer<br />Department of Commerce<br />National Institute of Standards and Technology</em><br />Gaithersburg, Maryland</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a study revealing that, for two facilities with lower levels falling below the water table, approximately 90,000 gallons of groundwater per day was being pumped into the utility storm drain system to keep the buildings dry. NIST began installing a groundwater recovery system in fiscal year 2007 to reroute the pumped groundwater to the cooling tower of NIST's steam and chilled water generation plant, thereby reducing the amount of purchased water required from the local utility. The project was completed in February 2008 with early metering data showing about 79,000 gallons per day being diverted to the cooling tower. The system saved 22 million gallons and more than $85,000 in the last 8 months of fiscal year 2008 and is expected to result in savings of approximately 33 million gallons and $128,000 in water costs annually. With a total project cost of $856,000, payback is estimated at less than 7 years.</p>
<p><em>Calvin Graves<br />Stephen Labus<br />James Mitchell<br />Robert Sapp<br />Kenneth Thayer<br />Department of the Interior<br />U.S. Geological Survey National Center</em><br />Reston, Virginia</p>
<p>Facility personnel at the Department of the Interior's U.S. Geological Survey National Center implemented water saving projects and measures that achieved dramatic water savings in fiscal year 2008. Five primary projects included retrofitting a condenser cooling system from a one-pass system to a closed-loop chilled water system; installing low-flow, solar-powered automated faucets; reducing landscape irrigation through minimizing flower beds, planting drought tolerant flowers, and reducing watering of grassy areas; repairing and making operational improvements to the cooling tower, and switching from ice cooled serving trays to refrigerated cold wells to eliminate use of an ice maker. These and other projects yielded savings of 2.9 million gallons in fiscal year 2008, a reduction of 14.4% from the previous year. Corresponding costs savings were $21,700"equal to 25% of the Center's annual water costs.</p>
<p><em>Marysia Davis<br />Julie Nowak<br />Vince Pumo<br />General Services Administration<br />Great Lakes Region</em><br />Chicago, Illinois</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, members of the General Service Administration's (GSA) Great Lakes Region team implemented a project to replace 85% of the faucets and flush valves in four facilities of the Chicago Federal Center Complex with automatic, water-efficient models to replace the existing manual faucets and hand/foot flush system. The project resulted in savings of more than 6.7 million gallons in the first year, with more than $34,000 in unrealized water cost savings for the partial year usage. It is estimated that cost savings for the Chicago Federal Center Complex may be much as $100,000 annually in fiscal year 2009 and beyond. The faucet and flush valve replacement was since expanded to include other federally-owned buildings in the Greater Chicagoland Service Center. The project also was deemed a regional "best practice," and has been adopted as the standard for all full scale replacements for the Great Lakes Region.</p>
<p><em>Robert Demyanovich<br />Ken Mears<br />Tom Santoianni<br />Richard Spiessl<br />Department of the Navy<br />Naval Base Ventura County</em><br />Port Hueneme, California</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) completed a water conservation program resulting in a 36% cut in water consumption from the fiscal year 2007 baseline. This water savings came at a crucial time for the base, as the water utility rate increased by 26% annually. Several centrally- and activity-funded initiatives were completed, including installing brand new irrigation systems with evapotranspiration controllers and replacing controllers on existing older systems; installing waterless urinals in 25 facilities; installing 1,800 low-flow showerheads in barracks and family housing units; and repairing leaking pools and water lines. These efforts saved a total of almost 225 million gallons and more than $270,000 in cost savings in fiscal year 2008. By reducing consumption, NBVC avoided paying almost $337,000 in additional water costs resulting from the higher fiscal year 2008 rate.</p>
<h4 id="waterind">Water Conservation Award to an Individual</h4>
<p><em>Walter Unick<br />Department of the Army<br />Picatinny Arsenal</em><br />Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey</p>
<p>Picatinny Arsenal owns its own water plant with fixed operaing costs. There is no direct relationship between water conservation and cost savings. But when base water consumption began approaching plant capacity in fiscal year 2008, Walter "Mickey" Unick initiated an aggressive leak detection and repair program to avoid construction costs of a new plant. Mr. Unick also implemented an automated system to provide status and control of the water plant, pumping, and storage; installed submeters in the distribution system to more easily identify losses and leaks; and installed automatic altitude control valves to balance pressure across the reservoir tank storage system. These efforts reduced water consumption by 31.7 million gallons–about 14%–from fiscal year 2007, despite an increase in Picatinny's operational activity levels and a population increase of about 30% over the past 18 months. Based on local water rates, this equates to cost savings of approximately $126,800.</p>
<h4 id="reneworg">Renewable Energy Awards to Organizations</h4>
<p><em>Department of Energy<br />Office of Management and<br />Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</em><br />Washington, DC</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, the Department of Energy (DOE) Headquarters Forrestal building installed a 205 kilowatt roof-top photovoltaic (PV) system comprised of 891 high-efficiency crystalline silicon modules. The system is expected to generate approximately 200 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually–equivalent to about 8% of the building's energy needs–and save $26,000 per year in energy costs. A unique feature of this effort is the technology showcase, which consists of four separate 1-kilowatt arrays each featuring a different photovoltaic technology. The showcase allows DOE's solar experts to compare performance during various temperature and weather conditions, and the removable panels easily can be replaced with new technologies as they emerge. Further, an educational kiosk in the Forrestal lobby shows the power output of the PV system during the day and the energy produced over time.</p>
<p><em>Department of the Interior<br />Bureau of Indian Affairs<br />Soutwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute</em><br />Albuquerque, New Mexico</p>
<p>In cooperation with the Department of Energy's Tribal Energy Program, in fiscal year 2008 the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) added a 70 kilowatt grid-connected building integrated photovoltaic roofing system to the SIPI gymnasium. The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane panels, which meet cool roof rating standards, provided an opportunity to generate alternative energy while providing a much needed roof replacement for the gym. The 17,000 square feet of photovoltaic panels generate 127 megawatt-hours of electricity, displacing more than 430 million Btu annually from fossil fuel generation. The system helps offset SIPI's overall power consumption, as excess energy not used by the gym is sent into SIPI's internal grid. In fiscal year 2008, the gym's electricity consumption alone decreased by 43%. The PV system is the largest in the state of New Mexico, and provided a template for another 45 kilowatt roof currently under construction for SIPI's administration building.</p>
<p><em>Department of the Navy<br />Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake</em><br />China Lake, California</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2008, Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake completed a 124 kilowatt photovoltaic carport structure that generates clean energy for the base and provides shade for cars of base personnel. The new carport will save approximately 785 million Btu of energy and $56,000 annually. Since the success of this initial PV project, the installation has added two more PV carports totaling 133 kilowatts, and is planning to implement additional PV carports, solar roofs, and solar thermal projects. As a result of base-wide conservation efforts, China Lake saved 39 billion Btu and 148 million gallons of water from fiscal year 2007, equating to almost $1.8 million in energy and water cost savings. China Lake's energy use in fiscal year 2008 was down 7% from the previous year, and nearly 23% below the fiscal year 2003 baseline. Water conservation at China Lake also progressed to nearly 23% below the 2007 baseline, due largely to the aggressive tuning of existing irrigation controllers.</p>
<p><em>Department of Veterans Affairs<br />James H. Quillen VA Medical Center</em><br />Mountain Home, Tennessee</p>
<p>In 2007 the James H. Quillen Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center began utilizing methane gas generated by waste decomposition at the local landfill for energy production. Due to the proximity of the medical center to the landfill, the City of Johnson City installed a 4-mile pipeline to the facility and infrastructure to clean and pressurize the gas. The landfill gas now replaces a portion of the natural gas utilized by the facility for steam and electricity production. During the first full year of operation in fiscal year 2008, the Medical Center generated almost 175 billion Btu of energy with landfill methane, accounting for 34% of the facility's total gas usage. The facility reduced its natural gas production by almost 72 billion Btu, saving approximately $1.5 million in energy costs. The project also prevents 3,000 tons of methane from being emitted from the landfill and avoids production of more than 7,500 tons of carbon dioxide each year.</p>
<h4 id="renewgrp">Renewable Energy Award to a Small Group</h4>
<p><em>Dennis Chiu<br />John Dunbar<br />Ronald Hochbrueckner<br />William Nutting<br />U.S. Marine Corps<br />Marine Corps Base Hawaii</em><br />Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii</p>
<p>Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) implemented its first photovoltaic renewable energy project using building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roofing panels. The MCBH Facilities Department team seized the opportunity to leverage planned maintenance-funded reroofing projects to help offset the high cost of PV installation in Hawaii. Rather than installing built-up asphalt roofing, two buildings each received polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane cool roofing and 8,000 square feet of BIPV panels. Together the two 65.2 kilowatt PV systems produce about 307 million Btu annually, which will save an estimated $18,000 per year in purchased electricity. The systems provide nearly 60% of each building's daily electricity requirements, displacing the fossil fuel-generated electricity previously purchased from the local utility company. These projects are now being replicated in renovation and reroofing projects for other MCBH facilities.</p>

<p>Daniel Wood is responsible for implementing the Lean Six Sigma Reduce Energy Cost project at Fort Eustis to educate the population on the importance of saving energy via Web site and mass notification to all base activities during peak electrical demand days. Employees received tips to turn off unused lights, keep shades closed, run appliances with high energy use in the early morning or late evening, unplug unused equipment, set building temperatures to 85 degrees in the summer when unoccupied, and others. Mr. Wood also negotiated a change in the base electrical rate schedule from the power company. Using eight years of central heating plant fuel consumption data, Mr. Wood implemented a fuel switching/selection program for Fort Eustis' central heating plants, selecting between fuel oil and natural gas to run steam generation plants based on the more favorable fuel price each month. Together, these activities resulted in energy savings of approximately 1.3 billion Btu and $2.4 million in utility cost avoidance.</p>
<p><em>Donald Thompson<br />National Aeronautics and Space Administration</em><br />Stennis Space Center, Mississippi</p>
<p>Stennis Space Center (SSC) utilizes an energy management control system (EMCS) to monitor and control HVAC systems. In fiscal year 2008, Donald Thompson spearheaded an effort to systematically evaluate the operating conditions at several high energy intensity buildings. Working with EMCS personnel, Mr. Thompson verified that HVAC equipment schedules matched occupancy schedules and identified equipment that was not operating properly. He also developed and implemented reset strategies for supply air temperature, supply air static pressure, heating and chilled water temperatures, and a sequence of operations that minimized or eliminated simultaneous heating and cooling. These efforts were critical to the success of SSC's energy management program, achieving energy savings of almost 5 billion Btu–or 48%–in the second half of fiscal year 2008 from the previous fiscal year. This equates to cost savings of almost $70,000 at no additional cost to SSC.</p>
<h4 id="service">Exceptional Service Awards</h4>
<p><em>Don Juhasz<br />Department of the Army<br />Office of the Assistant Chief for Installation Management</em><br />Arlington, Virginia</p>
<p>Over the last 18 years Don Juhasz used strong leadership skills and extensive expertise to reshaped the Army's Energy and Water program into a unified and highly coordinated campaign. As Chief of the Army's Energy and Utilities Programs, Mr. Juhasz directed accountability changes in the Army's Energy Conservation Investment Program and Energy Savings Performance Contracting Program to achieve $672 million in investment that will return $1.8 billion over the next 20 years. Mr. Juhasz also launched the Net Zero Installation Initiative and coordinated a multi-agency and private sector team to plan a 500 megawatt (MW) solar plant, a 30 MW geothermal plant, and an alternative fuel contract that will result in cost avoidance of more than $700 million over the next 30 years. He recently improved the Army's Awards Program, including the provision of cash rewards for Army accomplishments that resulted in $30 million in cost avoidance in fiscal year 2008. The climax of his accomplishments is the development of the first comprehensive Energy and Water Campaign Plan within the Federal sector, which defines actions, approaches, tools, technologies, and projects that will ensure the Army successfully achieves its long-range energy and water management goals.</p>
<p><em>Chris Drury<br />Department of the Navy<br />Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest</em><br />Silverdale, Washington</p>
<p>Chris Drury is the Navy Facilities Engineering Command Program Manager for energy efficiency and consumption reduction at Navy sites in the Northwest. Since he assumed the role in 2006, Navy's Northwest Region has consistently exceeded its energy goals. All Northwest sites met or exceeded the interim energy reduction goal of 9% in fiscal year 2008, with several sites reducing consumption by 12% to 16% below the fiscal year 2003 baseline. Under his leadership, the Region has implemented $22.9 million in large and small-scale energy projects that save 315 billion Btu and almost $3.1 million in energy costs annually. Mr. Drury does an outstanding job of researching, analyzing, and developing new technologies that show potential in the local climate, such as two large geothermal projects, photovoltaic and wind power projects, and the Region's first solar wall. Mr. Drury works hard to institutionalize energy efficiency, ensuring a team effort that reaches into all departments at all levels at all sites. He also facilitates an extensive outreach program that mobilizes base personnel to monitor their own energy use, and includes world-wide participation in Navy awareness events, frequent dissemination of energy awareness messages and energy tips, and continuous training and education.</p>
