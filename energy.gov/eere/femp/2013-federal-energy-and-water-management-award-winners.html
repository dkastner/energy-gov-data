<p id="jeffallen"><strong>Jeff Allen</strong><br />U.S. Marine Corps<br />Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California</p>
<p>Since 2000, Jeff Allen has managed the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton (MCBCP) energy program. During his tenure, MCBCP has reduced its energy intensity by 20.2% and lowered its water intensity by 48.8%. These savings were accomplished largely through Allen's efforts to develop, award, and execute 16 utility energy service contracts, which included projects worth $95 million and saved an aggregate of 352 billion Btu. He also implemented the base's first 3-kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) system in 2001 and leveraged various funding mechanisms to install 60 PV systems totaling 7.8 megawatts. Allen coordinated on many fronts to establish a successful resource energy manager program, deploy an automated meter infrastructure, expand the base energy management control system, implement a retro-commissioning effort covering an average of 2 million square feet per year, and conduct audits of the base's 16 million square feet of space leading to $80 million in projects with estimated savings of $10 million per year. As a result of Allen's leadership and dedication, MCBCP is on track to meet and exceed all Federal energy and water mandates.</p>

<p>Christine Hull, chief of the Operations and Maintenance Division at the Directorate of Public Works at Fort Bragg, has worked for the U.S. Department of Army for more than 16 years. At Fort Bragg, she ensures that members of the base energy team are included in every aspect of utilities maintenance and repair, allowing them to improve day-to-day base operations and resilience through efficiency. The base's success in keeping energy consumption down is attributed to the institutionalization of Hull's Energy "STORM" program, which "sustains" facilities by developing energy efficient projects, "trains" occupants in energy conservation practices, "operates" facilities at peak efficiency, "renews" facilities through retro-commissioning. and "measures" and "reports" energy consumption. Hull recently took the initiative to refinance an energy savings performance contract to gain $66 million in investments to improve controls and lighting power management and upgrade 12 central heating and cooling plants with a net decrease in monthly payments. She also drove the development of a Web-based application to manage and optimize work scheduling that resulted in a 4% increase in productivity in fiscal year (FY) 2012 from the prior year. Her focus on energy conservation and aggressive planning has resulted in $75.1 million in energy conservation and efficiency projects over the past three years, including $17.5 million in FY 2012.</p>

<p>The efforts of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) water resource management program resulted in savings of 255 million gallons of water and $300,000 in FY 2012, a 30% reduction from the prior year. The program comprehensively addresses minimizing water use, maximizing water reuse, and maximizing water quality by establishing and updating the lab's policies and plans that provide a foundation for coordinated lab efforts. ORNL integrates water resource management into new construction, renovations and retrofits, operations and maintenance, sustainable landscaping, and research and development. Recent energy savings performance contract projects include replacing heavy water-using equipment with low-flow fixtures and replacing the central compressed air plant with a more efficient facility that used an evaporative fluid cooler system, resulted in water savings of almost 170 million gallons annually. ORNL's campus-wide "Lab within a Park" approach protects water quality through native landscaping, minimizing runoff, and improving the management of riparian zones flowing through the campus. Overall the program has reduced ORNL's water intensity by almost 36% from the 2007 baseline. With plans that include eliminating additional once-through cooling and repairing leaks in the water distribution system, ORNL's projected potable water intensity for 2020 is more than a 50% reduction.</p>

<p>In May 2012, the Chillicothe VA Medical Center put into service the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) first operational biomass boiler plant, which saved 10 billion Btu of natural gas and more than $170,000 during the remainder of FY 2012 compared to FY 2011. The new innovative system provides most of the campus facility steam needs, while generating on-site electrical power. It produced 576,000 kilowatt-hours from the 400 kilowatt turbine in FY 2012. Project savings are expected to increase in FY 2013 as the facility operations staff maintains this state-of-the-art plant as the primary steam source for the campus. The plant was funded in part by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and replaced an aging, inefficient boiler plant and steam-distribution system. This renewable energy project was completed as part of an overall phased implementation plan for the campus to promote sustainable and cost-effective practices for the next 40-plus years. It will enable cost savings to be repurposed for veteran care and provide back-up for campus heating to maintain the emergency response and preparedness for the VA and the region.</p>

<p>In FY 2010, the U.S. General Services Administration New England Region entered into a design and build contract for the Cleveland Federal Building and the connected Rudman Courthouse in Concord, New Hampshire. The project implemented comprehensive upgrades and new energy-efficient, renewable-energy, and water-conserving measures that saved about 3.7 billion Btu and 137,000 gallons in FY 2012. A lighting redesign and retrofit was completed using the latest high-performance fixtures, ballasts, and lamps that reduce lighting energy density by more than 20%, for a projected minimum energy savings of about 594 million Btu per year. The new systems make use of dimmable ballasts, advanced lighting controls, and connection to the building management system to control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) demand. The roofing was replaced on both buildings with a 60 kilowatt grid-tied building integrated PV roof system at the Cleveland Building and an extensive modular tile vegetative roof system at the Rudman building. Other measures included HVAC upgrades, recovery of waste heat for domestic water heating and a parking lot snow melt system, building automation system upgrades, plumbing retrofits, and rainwater capture systems for landscaping.</p>

<p>Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka (CFAY) deployed a strategy to use more advanced technologies to improve energy efficiency across its large facility, executing $7.2 million in projects in FY 2012 to save about 7.9 billion Btu, 1.3 million gallons of water, and $625,000 in utility costs annually. CFAY completed an extensive energy retrofit project to replace existing exit signs with more than 5,600 light emitting capacitor (LEC) exit signs throughout the main base and all CFAY satellite locations-representing the largest utilization of LEC technology to date across Federal Government sites. CFAY also installed two large solar energy projects, including one crystalline PV system and a copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system. Using the CIGS technology incorporated into flexible thin-film panels enabled the site to adhere panels to an arched roof not suitable for traditionally-mounted PV panels. The 396-kilowatt system is the U.S. Navy's largest solar BIPV thin-film installation and the largest CIGS-type solar PV system in all of Asia. CFAY has already reduced its energy intensity by 58% relative to the FY 2003 baseline, and the total of 746 kilowatts installed in FY 2012 helps CFAY further reduce its dependence on the Japanese power grid.</p>

<p>During FY 2012, the U.S. General Services Administration's Greater Southwest Region used three energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) to leverage American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds to deliver $68 million in high-performance green buildings projects. For this total investment, of which $15.1 million was third-party financed, the region accomplished energy and water conservation projects in 75 facilities, saving an estimated $4.5 million per year in utility costs. Bundling renewable projects with shorter payback measures allowed for inclusion of 13 PV systems totaling 1.5 megawatts in capacity, two solar thermal systems, and one wind turbine, together producing about 7.8 billion Btu in electricity. In total, all projects yielded about 155.7 billion Btu and 25 million gallons of estimated energy and water savings in FY 2012. The ESPCs were used to bundle facilities spread throughout Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma into groups, saving money through economies of scale. This allowed the region to implement energy and water conservation projects in smaller or more remote facilities where they otherwise may not be cost-effective using stand-alone projects. Further, the design-build nature of the ESPCs allowed the projects to be developed and managed by fewer employees than through traditional construction methods.</p>

<p>During FY 2012, Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego (MCRDSD) completed several projects resulting in a 22% reduction in energy intensity and a 30% reduction in water intensity from the previous year, saving $872,000 in utility costs. The Depot constructed 3 new Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum-certified buildings with gray water recovery systems, induction lighting with advanced lighting controls, and a 990 kilowatt PV system designed to offset 75% of the connected electrical load. In total, 2.69 megawatts of new PV generation were completed, including a 1.7 MW solar farm, bringing the Depot's total PV system size to 3.6 megawatts. MCRDSD also installed a synthetic turf football field, a smart metering system, and an E85 gas pump in FY 2012. In partnership with Navy Facilities Engineer Command, the depot is hosting a project to collect black water from the existing sewer system and filter it through a tertiary water treatment system to provide usable water for subsurface irrigation, which will save about 365,000 gallons of potable water annually. Overall, these and other projects helped MCRDSD reduce its energy and water consumption by 35.8 billion Btu and 41.3 million gallons from the prior fiscal year.</p>

<p>At Mesa Verde National Park, the National Park Service constructed a new Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum-certified visitor and research center in FY 2012. Performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality were set at the earliest stages of the building delivery process. Achieving LEED Platinum certification was a difficult feat due to the special challenges of a curatorial facility that is also open to the public. Temperature, humidity, lighting levels, and contaminants must be carefully controlled, requiring innovative systems, precise design engineering, proper construction, and extensive commissioning to secure the priceless and irreplaceable artifacts. The building includes improved envelope; reduced lighting; advanced controls; high-efficiency ground-source heat pumps; energy recovery technology; chilled beams and slabs; and on-site renewable energy systems. A 67 kilowatt photovoltaic system, solar water heating system, and a micro-hydro turbine are able to provide 95% of the building energy requirements, or 627.9 million Btu annually. Landscape irrigation has been eliminated, and a wastewater treatment project and installation of dual flush water closets and low flow fixtures has reduced the site's potable water use by 40.7% from the baseline.</p>

<p>In January 2012 the General Services Administration's (GSA) Energy Division ran the first ever forward auction for demand response services by a Federal agency, resulting in awarded contracts expected to generate revenues of $1.5 million for the GSA and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). To date, the majority of Federal Government agencies participating in energy curtailment programs utilized a process through which they requested quotes from a handful of providers, then negotiated revenue shares and performance metrics on the provider's terms. GSA's competitive forward auction included approximately 24 megawatts (MW) of requirements, or about 8 MW annually over a three year term, for GSA and VA facilities that had previously enrolled in demand response programs under commercial terms dictated by providers. GSA received 70 bids from 10 approved demand response providers as a result of the auction. Of equal importance, GSA was able to shift all cost and performance risk from the Government to the providers. While dictating performance terms and shifting risk, GSA was able to increase the Government's share of revenues from 75% under the previous commercial agreements to 91.8% under GSA's terms, which can in turn be re-invested into energy reduction projects.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Region One executed a 13-year, $2.6 million energy savings performance contract (ESPC) in FY 2012, exceptional for its complexity, breadth, and logistical challenges. Forest Service Region One has more than 4000 buildings covering 25 million acres in the states of Montana, Northern Idaho, and South and North Dakota. The ESPC represents a major departure from the Region's former methods. Prior to the ESPC, energy conservation projects were small, localized efforts that applied one or two energy conservation measures at a particular site-slow progress to affect even a modest number of the Region's facilities. The new ESPC addresses 500 facilities at 62 sites served by 19 different utility providers, installing programmable thermostats, heat pumps, greenhouse furnaces, lighting, vacancy sensors, attic and foundation insulation, infiltration reduction measures, and a 4.9 kilowatt solar photovoltaic system. In total the projects are expected to save about 12.2 billion Btu and $250,000 in utility costs per year. This ESPC has already been used as a template for proposed projects for two other Forest Service regions.</p>

<p>In FY 2012, the U.S. Forest Service completed upgrades to the San Dimas Technology and Development Center (SDTDC), resulting in the first net-zero energy facility in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's portfolio. Net-zero energy status was accomplished by first installing numerous energy saving measures to the 48-year-old facility, including replacing the original heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system and installing a high efficiency boiler, energy efficient fluorescent lamps, plug load strips, and occupancy sensors. The facility then installed a 302 kilowatt PV system which is connected to the Southern California Edison (SCE) electrical grid. The PV system generates more than 100% of the facility's energy needs, and SCE applies a credit to both SDTD.C. and the Angeles National Forest Headquarters for excess energy the system generates. From July 2012, when the system first came on line, through the end of the calendar year the system generated more than 800 million Btu of renewable energy and resulted in a credit to SDTD.C. and to the Angeles National Forest SCE accounts of more than $13,000.</p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service completed its first net-zero energy Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum-certified building in FY 2012 at San Luis National Wildlife Refuge Complex. During the first year of operation, the 16,500 square-foot Headquarters and Visitor Center produced 352 billion Btu via nine solar PV arrays totaling 59.2 kilowatts. Technologies and strategies, such as structural insulated panels, a cool roof, tubular daylighting devices, clerestories, skylights, and operable low-e glazed windows, passive and evaporative cooling, and energy-efficient lighting yield energy performance better than 30% compared to an average building. Water use is reduced more than 35% with low-flow and waterless plumbing fixtures saving approximately 396,000 gallons annually. Xeriscaping, native plants, limited drip-irrigation, and stormwater containment conserve water outdoors. Low-volatile organic compound carpets, paints, and adhesives provide a healthy indoor work environment. Further, many building elements are composed of recycled materials including countertops, ceiling tiles, wallboard, wheat straw cabinetry, fly ash in the concrete, and certified sustainably harvested lumber, with 90% of construction waste recycled. Interpretation of the facility's green features is highlighted by dynamic, interactive exhibits for an estimated 150,000 visitors annually.</p>

<p>The National Park Service (NPS) designed and constructed a certified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum-rated visitor center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (NRA). The new facility is the first grid-tied, net-zero visitor center completed in the national park system.. It is also the first facility in the system designed with all light emitting diode (LED) electronics for all exterior and interior lighting fixtures. The 7,000 square foot building is heated and cooled by a highly efficient ground and water source heat pump system using an existing artificial pond as the primary heating and cooling source. A 94 kilowatt PV system provides all the energy needs for the facility. In fact, the PV system produced 310 billion Btu in the first year, or about 2.5 times net-zero. Surplus energy from the system helps to offset the carbon footprint from other facilities in the NRA. Extensive natural lighting along with the high-efficiency LED lighting with a daylight dimming system keeps electricity use at a minimal level. The facility was developed in partnership with California State Parks and a local park agency, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority.</p>

<p>The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold-rated Seymour Johnson Support Center project, completed in FY 2012, consolidated five functional organizations into a single facility to reduce energy consumption by 60% and lower utility costs by almost 50%, saving 3.6 billion Btu and $36,000 in the first year. Much of the efficiency was gained through the installation's first variable refrigerant-flow HVAC, which provides highly efficient heat and cooling year-round by precisely regulating refrigerant flow to maximize system efficiency regardless of building load and climate. This system also improves comfort by maintaining precise zone settings closer than conventional equipment. The HVAC system, combined with other energy savings measures, including an improved thermal envelope and high-efficiency lighting, reduce building energy use by almost 31% below standard construction of a comparable building. Installation of low-flow water fixtures and equipment reduced potable water use by 54% in FY 2012, saving more than 226,000 gallons. Furthermore, the project made possible the demolition of four buildings, resulting in an 18% reduction in overall building footprint.</p>

<p>During FY 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard completed an aggressive, agency-wide advanced metering infrastructure project, with estimated annual savings of about 19.8 billion Btu and $624,000. The project installed a robust meter network that provides wireless electricity data from 1,960 meters spread over 220 Coast Guard sites. The meters transmit time interval electrical consumption data from discrete sources, such as individual electrical panels, buildings, and vessel shore ties, to a local data acquisition server. While Federal mandates emphasize that meter data can drive facility energy reductions, the Coast Guard is going further by implementing programmatic enhancements in energy analysis. Data from the advanced meters is being used to identify opportunities for efficiency improvements, verify savings of efficiency measures, influence an energy conscious culture, and streamline energy reporting processes. The Coast Guard now has detailed data for the sites that account for 75% of its total shore electricity consumption. Conservative estimates attribute a 2% reduction in overall energy consumption due to the installation of meters. At this rate, the $8 million project will pay for itself in less than 13 years.</p>

<p>After five years of planning and coordination with several stakeholders, in FY 2012, <span id="MarineCorpsAirStationMiramar">Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</span> completed a landfill gas (LFG) and power purchase agreement (PPA) that brings the installation's energy consumption to 50% of its load generated from renewable energy on-site. The LFG PPA is a 15-year agreement to purchase 3.2 megawatts of renewable power, which generates 94.3 billion Btu per year. The LFG plant extracts gas from the 476-acre Miramar Landfill, owned by the <span id="MarineCorpsRecruitDepotSanDiego">U.S. Marine Corps and leased and operated by the City of San Diego. Miramar and Naval Facilities Engineering Command contracted directly with Fortistar LLC and the City of San Diego to purchase the power from the LFG-generating plant. A separate project constructed three miles of electrical distribution lines to transmit the power produced at the landfill to a transformer that provides power to multiple critical facilities. The success of this project was a key factor in the U.S. Department of Defense allocating $18 million in FY 2014 special military construction funds to install a base-wide micro grid. The micro grid will use LFG and traditional generation to provide energy independence for the entire base, helping Miramar to meet its aggressive goal to be energy independent by FY 2017. </span></p>
