<p><strong>Jonathan Spanier</strong><br /><em>Professor of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Drexel University</em></p>
<p>Jonathan E. Spanier is an associate professor of materials science &amp; engineering, and a member of the A J Drexel Institute for Energy &amp; the Environment at Drexel University in Philadelphia, researching and teaching solid state science and electronic materials. Spanier received the PhD in applied physics from Columbia University in 2001. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship in physical chemistry at Harvard University prior to joining the Drexel faculty in 2003, where as an associate dean of Engineering he recently led in the development of its 2013-18 Strategic Plan and directs the University’s core materials characterization and microfabrication user facilities.</p>
<p>Spanier investigates the structure, chemistry and properties of new environmentally-friendly polar oxide perovskites for efficient and low-cost photovoltaic solar energy conversion. With colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania, Spanier co-invented of the first semiconducting absorber that possesses a compositionally-tunable band gap spanning the visible spectrum and is simultaneously polar for promoting carrier separation without a junction.  He and his group recently showed how low-energy atomic layer deposition of amorphous layers and controlled epitaxialization can be used to produce heteroepitaxial single-crystalline misfit dislocation-free perovskite oxide films.</p>
<p>Spanier received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the ARO Young Investigator Award, and the Distinguished Service Award from the Louis R Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.  Spanier was an ONR Senior Faculty Fellow, is a Louis and Bessie Stein Family Fellow, and in 2014 was awarded a Japan Trust International Research Cooperation Fellowship.
