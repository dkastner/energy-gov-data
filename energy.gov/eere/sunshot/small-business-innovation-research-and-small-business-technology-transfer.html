The incorporation of high strength, relatively high modulus ceramic fiber reinforcement within a ceramic matrix produces a material with significantly greater toughness, flaw insensitivity, and strain capability than a monolith, while maintaining high-temperature refractory capabilities. Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (SiC/SiC) offers the necessary high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance, and has been identified as a suitable candidate material for the high-flux portion of the solar receiver. This effort encompassed the design of a pressurized ceramic matrix composite (CMC) tubular solar receiver; the demonstrated fabrication of receiver prototypes and material for coupon-level materials testing; and the evaluation of thermal and mechanical materials properties, as well as the structural and thermal performance of the solar receiver prototypes.</p>
<p><strong>Next Energy Technologies, Inc.</strong> (Santa Barbara, CA)<br /><em>Reliability Improvement in Solution Processable Roll to Roll Photovoltaic Modules</em><br />Next Energy Technologies (NEXTs) soluble small molecule (SSM) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells promises to lower the cost per watt of modules and also the balance of system costs below the goals of SunShot. NEXT’s SSM-OPVs can be coated as inks onto conventional plastic rolls in high yields using roll-to-roll technology and allowing for the production of lightweight, flexible, and extremely inexpensive solar cells. This project focuses on enhancing inherent device stability in order to increase product lifetime and reduce the cost of vapor barrier and packaging materials required for modules.</p>
<p><strong>United Silicon Carbide, Inc.</strong> (Middlesex, NJ)<br /><em>15 kV GTO Thyristor Module for Use in Small, Highly Efficient Current Source Inverters Utilizing AC-Link™ Technology</em><br />United Silicon Carbide and Princeton Power Systems fabricated a switch module that is rated at 15 kV, thus usable for switching voltages up to ~11 kV. Adopting a bipolar p-type SiC-GTO approach, coupled with the AC-link™ topology, allows the device to switch in the medium voltage range while maintaining low losses and a high switching speed (~10 KHz). Switching at medium voltages allows the current to be reduced drastically by a factor of ~10, thus impacting every other component in the inverter. The module provides a significantly smaller, more efficient and lower cost solution for converters/inverters for utility scale smart grid and energy management applications.</p>

<p><strong>Glint Photonics, Inc. </strong>(Menlo Park, CA)<br />Wide Angle Self-Tracking Concentrator Photovoltaics</p>
<p>Glint Photonics is developing a novel high-concentration PV module that eliminates the need for costly precision mechanical trackers by enabling automatic solar tracking within the concentrator itself. Novel optical designs embed optical materials that respond to sunlight within the concentrator, allowing the proposed concentrator to track the sun over a wide range of incidence angles. This could reduce cost by enabling the concentrating PV modules to be mounted on rooftops, other stationary configurations, or on low-cost single-axis trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Power Converters, Inc. </strong>(Spicewood, TX)<br />3-Port PV and Battery Converter Improves Cost and Efficiency of Combined PV/Battery Systems</p>
<p>Integrating low-cost battery storage with intermittent solar PV generation plants is the goal of high-penetration PV, but when PV and battery systems are used together, the converter-related balance-of-system (BOS) costs and efficiency losses can be doubled. This is because multiple power converters and multiple power converter steps are required. Ideal Power Converters is developing and demonstrating a three-Port PV &amp; battery converter concept to reduce converter losses, thereby improving system efficiency and reducing installation and converter costs for hybrid systems that integrate Solar PV with battery storage.</p>
<p><strong>Inspired Light, LLC </strong>(Corvallis, OR)<br />Self-Configuring Solar Tracking System</p>
<p>Inspired Light will develop and demonstrate a self-configuring solar tracking mechanism and controller that will enable low-profile, self-contained tracking assemblies to be deployed quickly. The tracker will be controlled by a unique motion controller, borrowed from consumer electronics design, to enable reductions in size, weight, hardware cost, and installation time. When Inspired Light's technology is integrated with high-efficiency, low-cost PV modules developed in-house, the result will be a comprehensive low-cost and self-contained system that can be rapidly deployed in ground-mount or rooftop applications.</p>

<p>MicroXact is developing a high-throughput, in-line photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing diagnostic system that provides data on the spatial uniformity of thickness, refractive indices, and film stress of the thin films comprising the solar cell as it is processed reel-to-reel. This information has the potential to detect a wide variety of processing errors, including but not limited to thickness/composition inhomogeneity in any layer-comprising PV device, non-uniform scribing, thin-film stress, cracking, and layer separation.</p>
<p><strong>Tau Science Corporation</strong> (Beaverton, Oregon)<br />Optimizing PV Solar Manufacturing Efficiency through Real-Time Process Feedback and Spectral Binning of Cells</p>
<p>Tau Science is investigating advanced metrology concepts for solar cell manufacturing. At present, manufacturers lack immediate feedback on key process steps such as junction formation and film deposition. This gap is particularly evident when an offline sampling plan cannot be easily implemented for continuous roll processing. In response, non-contact, electro-optic techniques are being developed to extract semiconductor bandgap and full spectrum photoresponse. These techniques, if successful, may be implemented inline for improved process feedback and control.</p>

<p><strong>Colnatec LLC </strong>(Gilbert, Arizona)<br />Self-Cleaning Process Control Sensor for Thin-Film Solar Cell Manufacturing </p>
<p>Colnatec is developing a thin-film deposition process control and measurement sensor for the fabrication of CIGS and related thin-film solar cells. The unique capability of this sensor is the ability to operate at temperatures up to 1000°C. This opens the door to monitoring CIGS furnace processes, solar cell surface chemistry, and crystalline phase formation, which can ultimately lead to the highest efficiency PV cells possible. A side benefit is this same sensor operates better than current technologies in organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD), the leading process for making flexible (OLED) lighting, flexible electronics circuits, and low-cost organic PV panels.</p>
<p><strong>Spire Corporation </strong>(Bedford, Massachusetts)<br />Next-Generation, LED-based, Adjustable Spectrum, Pulsed Solar Simulator</p>
<p>Spire's next-generation solar simulators incorporate arrays of high-reliability, low-voltage, solid-state light emitting diodes that emit across the entire solar spectrum to generate light whose spectrum can be electronically programmed. This makes it possible to use one simulator to rapidly test silicon, thin film, concentrator, or other solar modules as they emerge from the manufacturing assembly line. The electronically tunable spectrum feature is useful for diagnosing the performance of multi-junction tandem cells, where each junction of the tandem cell can be independently evaluated for current generation and efficiency. Designed to operate in a "flasher" mode, light flashes of arbitrary duration can be keyboard controlled. Because the system is based on a modular design, simulators of arbitrary size can be assembled.</p>
<p><strong>Spire Corporation</strong> (Bedford, Massachusetts)<br />Photoluminescence for Solar Cell Crack Detection</p>
<p>Spire Corporation is developing an automated system using photoluminescence (PL) imaging for detecting microcracks in mono- and multi-crystalline silicon solar cells. Unlike electroluminescence, which requires probing of a cell that is complete with electrical contacts, PL is a non-contact technique that can be used to monitor cell quality at any step in the cell fabrication process. High-quality, 1-megapixel PL images of 156-mm-square cells are being obtained with a laser illuminator and an infrared linescan camera in 2.3 seconds or less. Image processing software is being developed to automatically identify cells with microcracks. A prototype high throughput (1,200 cells/hour) system is being built and tested.</p>

<p><strong>Nano EnerTex, Inc.</strong> (Houston, Texas)<br />Ultra-Thin III-V Films for Tandem Photovoltaic Application</p>
<p>Nano EnerTex partnered with the University of Houston to demonstrate that ultra-thin (&lt; 1 micron) dual-junction solar cells with practical efficiencies in excess of 25% may be achieved through careful design optimization. The team evaluated the design parameters as a function of dislocation densities for devices that comprise a 1.7 electron volt (eV) top AlGaAs solar cell and a 1.25 eV bottom GaAs(N)Sb cell. The experimental validation of modeling data on thin-film subcells grown on intentionally dislocated buffers indicated that even for defect densities in excess of 108cm<sup>-2</sup>, top and bottom cells with open-circuit voltages of in excess of 1 and 0.75 volts (V) respectively were obtained. These findings stress the potential for fabricating high-efficiency, defect-tolerant, thin-film III-V devices.</p>

<p><strong>Creative Light Source, Inc.</strong> (Boulder, Colorado)<br />Holographic Passively Tracking Planar Solar Concentrator</p>
<p>Creative Light Source developed a holographic solar concentrator based on the concept of an inexpensive holographic film applied to a 2-mm-thick panel of glass or plastic. Photons are captured by the hologram, trapped within the panel and funneled via internal reflection to thin PV strips at the panel edge. One of the advantages of using this technology in a solar panel is that the holograms provide the ability to track the sun without any moving parts. The panels are fixed in space and multiple hologram layers are used to trap the sun's light from different angles.</p>

<p><strong>TDA Research, Inc.</strong> (Wheat Ridge, Colorado)<br />A New Three-Part Architecture for Efficient and Stable Bulk Heterojunction OPV Devices</p>
<p>The project extended the range of operation of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPV) that are based on poly(3-hexyl)thiophene:fullerene blends further into the red (from ~630 nm to ~850 nm and beyond), while retaining the inexpensive solution processing characteristics of the binary blend. The ternary component of the new architectures was selected from a range of soluble yet relatively easy-to-synthesize organic dye molecules. Issues related to device stability were addressed by eliminating chemically unstable materials, which are unnecessary in the new architecture.</p>
<p><strong>SVV Technology Innovations, Inc.</strong> (Sacramento, California)<br />Concentrator PV Receiver Based on Crystalline Si Cells</p>
<p>The project aimed to solve the problem of inherent complexity in concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) by developing an innovative module. The CPV module employs a novel slat-array solar concentrator and a linear receiver based on off-the-shelf crystalline silicon cells. The open web frame concentrator structure offers a low-cost alternative to parabolic trough collectors. It also reduces the wind drag, thereby reducing the weight of the support frame as well as providing a highly uniform concentrated flux on the cells without losses associated with secondary optics.</p>
<p><strong>MicroLink Devices</strong> (Niles, Illinois)<br />Backside Contact Multijunction Solar Cells for High Concentration Applications </p>
<p>This project developed a method for fabricating multijunction solar cells with backside contacts to improve cell efficiency under high concentration. Backside contacts have been applied to crystalline solar cells to achieve record efficiencies by reducing grid shadowing and resistive losses. Under high optical concentrations used in CPV systems, the losses associated with the topside grid metal increases significantly. The fabrication process developed etches via holes in the epitaxial structures to move the electrical grid to the backside of the device.</p>

<p>Nrgtek developed a patented technology for desalination of saline waters, using forward osmosis technologies and organic-draw solutes as the osmotic agent. These organic solutes have the property of solubility inversion, allowing them to phase separate from aqueous solutions at higher temperatures. These higher temperatures can be obtained by solar water heating technologies, as well as low-grade waste heat. Using this technology, the energy cost of desalination may come down to 1 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> of water produced, as compared to 3.5 kWh/ m<sup>3</sup>of water produced by reverse osmosis.</p>
<p><strong>Versatilis, LLC</strong> (Shelburne, Vermont)<br />Electret Field Enhanced Organic Solar Cells</p>
<p>Versatilis worked to develop a novel approach enabling OPV cells to potentially reach &gt; 10% efficiency by integrating into such OPV structures an "externally" created electric field from trapped static dielectric charges in the form of electrets, hence "Electretic" Solar Cells. Such an externally induced field can extend exciton diffusion paths; aid in transporting charge carriers to contact electrodes; and minimize recombination, trapping, and the formation of space charges that otherwise oppose drift of carriers of the same charge. It can apply to any number of solar cell structures, including OPV cells from the leading OPV manufacturers, and potentially to inorganic PV cells, even retrofitted to existing cells.</p>
<p><strong>Luna Innovations, Inc.</strong> (Roanoke, Virginia)<br />Advancement of Nano-Material Production for OPV Acceptors</p>
<p>Endohedral metallofullerenes, and in particular trimetallic nitride endohedral metallofullerenes (Trimetaspheres®), have unique chemical, thermal, optical, and electronic properties that make them suitable as electron acceptor materials in OPV devices. However, their applications are restricted by the high costs and low productivity of the current synthesis methods. The conventional synthetic method primarily employs the Krätschmer-Huffman electric arc discharge reactor with packed electrodes. Luna Innovations developed and validated a new generation of arc discharge process and reactors for the synthesis of Trimetaspheres®, such as Lu3N@C80 and Gd3N@C80, achieving higher yields and productivity while eliminating the use of expensive process gases and the labor-intensive electrode packing process.</p>
<p><strong>Solarno, Inc.</strong> (Coppell, Texas)<br />Parallel Tandem Organic Solar Cells with Carbon Nanotube Sheet Interlayers</p>
<p>This project aimed to create prototypes of flexible, thin-film, high efficiency (&gt; 10%) multilayer organic solar cells with broad spectral sensitivity. The team stacked different types of solar cells in a proprietary parallel monolithic architecture. Transparent carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets dry-drawn from CNT forests were used as common electrode interlayers in which photocurrents of sub-cells were added to increase the efficiency. The CNT sheets provide three-dimensional structure to increase the contact area between electrode and photoactive layers, and its superior mechanical strength allows for the construction of OPV tandems on rough surfaces and on highly flexible deployable substrates.</p>
<p><strong>Luminit, LLC</strong> (Torrance, California)<br />Solar Photovoltaic HOlographic Cogeneration (SPHOC) System</p>
<p>Luminit developed a new Solar Photovoltaic HOlographic Cogeneration (SPHOC) system based on unique spectrum-splitting, sun tracking Spectral and Angle Multiplexed HOlographic Concentrator (SAM-HOC) technology. Without any mechanical movement, the SAM-HOC tracks the sun and efficiently separates the visible portion for the standard PV cell from the thermal portion of the solar spectrum, which is used to efficiently generate thermal or electric energy. SPHOC is able to continuously convert the focused sunlight in the visible and near infrared (NIR) to cogenerate electric or thermal energy.</p>
<p><strong>SVV Technology Innovations, Inc.</strong> (Sacramento, California)<br />Hybrid Slat-Array PV System with Thermal Co-Generation</p>
<p>The project developed a deployable solar energy-harvesting module, which employs a novel linear solar concentrator structure called the Slat-Array Concentrator (SAC) and a hybrid receiver that combines two energy conversion components: photovoltaic and thermal. The co-generation within a single concentrator module enables higher sunlight conversion efficiencies than can be achieved with conventional photovoltaic panels and thermal collectors as well as offers significant material savings compared with using separate PV and thermal modules.</p>
