With this in mind, EERE has established a set of PEV charging infrastructure principles to guide its efforts and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

While PEVs are on the rise nationally, the Energy Department’s Workplace Charging Challenge made big strides in 2016 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>5 Questions with David Friedman: From FutureCar to the Future of Clean Energy</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/5-questions-david-friedman-futurecar-future-clean-energy</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;During his time in college 20 years ago, David Friedman joined the FutureCar Challenge team to broaden his perspective of hybrid and battery-electric vehicles. In a sit down interview, EERE&#039;s Acting Assistant Secretary explains how he had no idea back then how much that experience would shape his future career.&lt;/p&gt;
