<h4><a name="abouttool" id="abouttool">About this Mapping Tool</a></h4>
<p>This wind career map explores an expanding universe of wind energy occupations, describing diverse jobs across the industry, charting possible progression between them, and identifying the high-quality training necessary to do them well.</p>
<p>Sectors: The career map arranges wind occupations into four broad categories: Project Development; Component Manufacturing; Construction; Operations; Education, Training, and Research. There is much overlap and conversation between these sectors, and some jobs could sit in more than one.</p>
<p>Skill Levels: The map also organizes jobs into three general skill levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry Level - Pre-apprentice or apprentice-level, less than a 2-year post-secondary credential, 1-3 years' experience.</li>
<li>Mid-Level - Journey or associate's level, 3-5 years' experience.</li>
<li>Advanced Level - Master craft or bachelor's level and higher, 5+ years' experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the designated level of a job title on this map, most occupations include a wide range of skill levels, and could sit higher or lower on the y-axis. As wind technology rapidly evolves, workers in all positions will need to update their skills through continuing education or on-the-job-training, and in many cases could benefit from professional certification.</p>
<p>Jobs: This tool maps a broad and representative selection of occupations for which some training in wind-specific skills is required. Not every wind job is listed. And not every job listed devotes the majority of its time to wind work. But each one plays a critical role in building a safe and robust wind industry.</p>
<p>Job Details: Look here for a more complete picture of the job in a wind context, including: typical education, training, and experience; skills and responsibilities; median wages.</p>
<p>Pathways: Labor markets are organized as lattices, not ladders. There are many possible career routes within and across wind sectors for workers seeking advancement or new opportunities. This tool maps some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Routes to Advancement chart logical transitions from one job to another, offering general information about training or credentials needed to make the move. Advances within an occupation—from apprentice to journeyman, say, or specialist to manager—are not mapped as linked dots, but indicated within the full job description.</li>
<li>Multi-Sector Routes show how several occupational transitions could be linked into career paths across wind industry sectors. Some of the transitions imply enormous advances in skill, credentials, and education; they offer a birds-eye guide to affinity and potential, rather than a topographical map of specific work and learning pathways.</li>
</ul>
