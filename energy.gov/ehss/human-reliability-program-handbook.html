<p>The HRP is a security and safety reliability program designed to ensure that individuals who occupy positions affording access to certain materials, nuclear explosive devices, facilities, and programs meet the highest standards of reliability and physical and mental suitability. This objective is accomplished through a system of continuous evaluation that identifies individuals whose judgment and reliability may be impaired by physical or mental/personality disorders, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, the abuse of legal drugs or other substances, or any other condition or circumstance that may be of a security or safety concern.</p>
<h4><a name="certified" id="certified"></a>Who must be HRP certified?</h4>
<p>HRP certification is required for individuals assigned to or applying for a position that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affords access to Category I Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) or has responsibility for transporting or protecting Category I quantities of SNM.</li>
<li>Involves nuclear explosive duties or has responsibility for working with, protecting, or transporting nuclear explosives, nuclear devices, or selected components.</li>
<li>Affords access to information concerning vulnerabilities in protective systems when transporting nuclear explosives, nuclear devices, selected components, or Category I quantities of SNM.</li>
</ul>
<p>A position not listed above, which affords the potential to significantly affect national security or cause unacceptable damage, can be nominated as an HRP position. Before such nomination, the Manager or the HRP management official must analyze the risks the position poses for the particular operational program. If the analysis shows that more restrictive physical, administrative, or other controls could be implemented that would prevent the position from being designated an HRP position, those controls will be implemented if practical.</p>
<p>All HRP nominations must be approved by the NNSA Administrator, the Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer, or the appropriate Lead Program Secretarial Officer.</p>
<h4><a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>What are the HRP requirements?</h4>
<p><strong>DOE Q security clearance (access authorization).</strong> A type of security clearance granted by DOE indicating the recipient is approved for access to the following levels of classified matter on a need-to-know basis: Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential Restricted Data, National Security Information, and Formerly Restricted Data.</p>
<p><strong>Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP), Part 2.</strong> The annual submission of this information enables DOE Personnel Security to update the personnel security file, which is reviewed annually to ensure that security concerns are identified.</p>
<p><strong>Signed releases, acknowledgments, and waivers.</strong> You must review and sign documents to facilitate the collection and dissemination of information and the performance of medical assessments and drug and alcohol testing.</p>
<p><strong>Completion of HRP instruction.</strong> HRP instruction must be completed for initial certification and annual recertification. The instruction includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objectives of the HRP</li>
<li>The role and responsibilities of each HRP-certified individual including:
<ul>
<li>Recognizing and responding to behavioral change and aberrant or unusual behavior that may result in a risk to national security or nuclear explosive safety</li>
<li>Recognizing and reporting security concerns</li>
<li>Reporting prescription drug use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requirements for returning to work after sick leave</li>
<li>The HRP continuous evaluation process</li>
<li>For those who have nuclear explosive responsibilities, a detailed explanation of duties and safety requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counterintelligence (CI) evaluation.</strong> Individuals who occupy certain HRP positions may be required to successfully complete a CI evaluation; however, it is no longer a general requirement because of revisions to 10 CFR Part 709, Counterintelligence Evaluation Program. Under the revised regulation, each site will designate positions in accordance with the regulation’s criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Completion of reviews, evaluations, and assessments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Supervisory review</em>. Each supervisor of an HRP candidate or HRP-certified individual must conduct an initial and annual review to evaluate information (including security concerns) relevant to that individual’s suitability to perform HRP tasks in a reliable and safe manner.</li>
<li><em>Medical assessment</em>. The medical assessment is performed for initial certification and then annually for recertification. A medical assessment may be performed more often if required by the site occupational medical director (SOMD). The designated physician, under the supervision of the SOMD, is responsible for the medical assessment of HRP candidates and HRP-certified individuals. In performing this responsibility, the designated physician or the SOMD must integrate the medical evaluation, available test results, the psychological evaluation, a review of current legal drug use, and any other relevant information. This information is used to determine if a safety or security reliability concern exists and if the individual is medically qualified for HRP duties.
<ul>
<li><em>Psychological evaluation</em>. As part of the medical assessment, a psychological evaluation must be conducted for initial HRP certification. This evaluation consists of a psychological assessment (test) and a semi-structured interview. For recertification, the evaluation consists of a semi-structured interview, but a psychological test may also be conducted if warranted. Every third year, the psychological evaluation includes a psychological test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Management evaluation</em>. The HRP management official considers the results of the supervisory review, medical assessment, drug and alcohol test results, and any other information relating to an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, and makes a recommendation regarding certification.</li>
<li><em>DOE personnel security review</em>. A personnel security specialist will perform a personnel security file review upon receiving the individual’s supervisory review, medical assessment, and management evaluation and recommendation. Security concerns identified at any stage of the certification process will be evaluated and resolved in accordance with DOE regulations for access to classified matter or special nuclear materials in 10 CFR Part 710.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drug and alcohol testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Initial</em>. All HRP candidates will be tested for the use of alcohol and illegal drugs before HRP certification is granted.</li>
<li><em>Random drug test</em>. HRP-certified individuals are selected randomly, at least once in every 12-month period, for unscheduled and unannounced testing for the presence of illegal drugs. A confirmed positive drug test is considered a security concern that will result in immediate removal from HRP duties and adjudication under the criteria and guidelines found in 10 CFR Part 710.</li>
<li><em>Random alcohol test</em>. HRP-certified individuals are selected randomly, at least once in every 12-month period, for unscheduled and unannounced testing for the presence of alcohol. A positive test is an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater on a confirmatory test. A person who tests positive will be sent home and not be allowed to perform HRP duties for 24 hours. The management official will be notified.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No use of a hallucinogen (LSD) in the preceding five years and no experience of flashback resulting from the use of LSD more than five years before applying for certification or recertification.</li>
<li>Individuals performing nuclear explosive duties, and others in designated positions, are prohibited from consuming alcohol within an eight-hour period preceding scheduled work.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="performed" id="performed"></a>How often are HRP requirements performed?</h4>
<p>You must receive HRP certification before performing HRP duties and then be recertified every 12 months. The table below details the interval at which each requirement is performed.</p>

<h4><a name="responsibilities" id="responsibilities"></a>What are my HRP responsibilities?</h4>
<p>As an HRP-certified individual, you have several responsibilities. You must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read, sign, and submit HRP releases, acknowledgments, and waivers to facilitate the collection and dissemination of information and the performance of medical examinations and drug and alcohol tests.</li>
<li>Provide full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions and, when requested, furnish or authorize others to furnish information that DOE deems pertinent to reaching a decision on HRP certification or recertification.</li>
<li>Notify the designated physician, the designated psychologist, or the SOMD immediately of a physical or mental condition that requires medication or treatment.</li>
<li>Report reliability concerns, including any observed or reported behavior or condition of another HRP-certified individual, to a supervisor, the designated physician, the designated psychologist, the SOMD, or the HRP management official.</li>
<li>If you have any behavior or condition that may affect your ability to perform your HRP duties, you must make a report to your supervisor, the designated physician, the designated psychologist, the SOMD, or the HRP management official.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You are also required to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Report in person to the designated physician, the designated psychologist, or the SOMD to obtain a written recommendation to return to work if you have been on sick leave for 5 or more consecutive days (or an equivalent amount of time).</li>
<li>Report for drug or alcohol testing if required following involvement in an incident, unsafe practice, or an occurrence, or if there is a reasonable suspicion that you may be impaired.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can HRP certification be transferred?</strong></p>
<p>An individual's HRP certification may be transfered to another site. However, before the individual is allowed to perform HRP duties at the new site, it must be verified that the individual is currently HRP certified and is transferring into a designated HRP position. Additionally, the individual must be provided site-specific instruction and incorporated into the new site’s alcohol and drug testing program. It must also be ensured that the 12-month time period for HRP requirements that was established at the prior site is not exceeded.</p>
<p>Temporary assignment to an HRP position at another site requires verification that the individual is currently HRP certified and has completed all site-specific instruction. The individual is required to return to the site that maintains his or her HRP certification for recertification.</p>
<h4><a name="report" id="report"></a>When should I report a concern?</h4>
<p>As you learned in the responsibilities section, you must report the observed or reported behavior or condition of an HRP-certified individual that could indicate a safety or security reliability concern. Simply put, a reliability concern is any behavior or condition that is unusual or out of the ordinary that could potentially affect a person’s ability to adhere to security and safety requirements.</p>
<p>Terms you should be familiar with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>. An individual’s ability to adhere to security and safety requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Safety concern</strong>. Any condition, practice, or violation that causes a substantial probability of physical harm, property loss, and/or environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Security concern</strong>. Information regarding an HRP candidate or HRP-certified individual that may be considered derogatory under the criteria listed in 10 CFR §710.8.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="concern" id="concern"></a>What might be a concern?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mental/personality or physical disorder that impairs performance</li>
<li>Conduct that warrants referral for a criminal investigation or results in arrest or conviction</li>
<li>Indication of deceitful or delinquent behavior</li>
<li>Attempted or threatened destruction of property or life</li>
<li>Suicidal tendencies or attempted suicide</li>
<li>Use of illegal drugs; abuse of legal drugs or other substances</li>
<li>Alcohol use disorder</li>
<li>Recurring financial irresponsibility</li>
<li>Irresponsibility in performing assigned duties</li>
<li>Inability to deal with stress, or the appearance of being under unusual stress</li>
<li>Failure to comply with work directives; violation of safety or security procedures</li>
<li>Hostility or aggression toward fellow workers or authority; uncontrolled anger</li>
<li>Repeated absenteeism</li>
<li>Significant behavioral changes, moodiness, depression</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not intended to be all-inclusive. If a behavior is not in character for a person, or if it appears the behavior could be a result of drug or alcohol abuse, stress, or serious personal problems/issues, it should be reported as a concern.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report</strong> anything supicious</li>
<li><strong>Be Alert</strong> to unusual behaviors or conditions</li>
<li><strong>Be concerned</strong> for the safety of your coworkers and the environment and for the security of the nation.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Content">
<h4><a name="ireport" id="ireport"></a>How do I report a concern?</h4>
<p>If you have a concern about an HRP worker’s physical or mental condition, behavior, or actions, immediately report it to any supervisor, the designated physician, the designated psychologist, the SOMD, or the HRP management official.</p>
<h4><a name="identified" id="identified"></a>What happens when a reliability concern is identified?</h4>
<p>If a reasonable belief or credible evidence exists than an HRP-certified individual is not reliable, his or her supervisor must immediately do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require the individual to stop performing HRP duties.</li>
<li>Ensure the individual is denied both escorted and unescorted access to the HRP work areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within 24 hours after taking the above actions, the supervisor must provide written notification to both the individual and the HRP management official of the reason for the actions.</p>
<p>Immediate removal from HRP duties is an interim, precautionary action and does not constitute a determination that the individual is not fit to perform his or her required duties. Removal is not, in itself, a cause for loss of pay, benefits, or other changes in employment status.</p>
<h4><a name="hrpduties" id="hrpduties"></a>What happens when someone is removed from HRP duties?</h4>
<p>If removal is due to a <strong>security</strong> concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>The HRP management official must notify the HRP certifying official and the applicable DOE personnel security office. The concern is investigated and adjudicated by DOE personnel security under the criteria and procedures in 10 CFR Part 710.</li>
</ul>
<p>If removal is due to a <strong>safety</strong> concern, the HRP management official:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluates the circumstances or information that led to the removal of the individual from HRP duties.</li>
<li>Prepares a written report of the evaluation that includes a determination of the individual’s reliability for continuing HRP certification.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the HRP management official determines that an individual who has been temporarily removed continues to meet the requirements for certification, he or she must notify:</p>
<ul>
<li>The individual’s supervisor, directing that the individual be allowed to return to HRP duties.</li>
<li>The individual.</li>
<li>The HRP certifying official.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an individual has been temporarily removed, the certifying official* takes one of the following three actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reinstates, and provides a written explanation of the factual basis for the action.</li>
<li>Continues temporary removal and directs action to resolve concerns (for example, rehabilitation). After completion of intervention, the matter will be reevaluated.</li>
<li>Revokes certification, sending a written decision, which includes rationale for the action and the procedures for reconsideration/appeal, to the affected individual by certified mail.</li>
</ol>
<p>* In some facilities the Manager may serve as the certifying official</p>
</div>
<h4><a name="options" id="options"></a>What are my options?</h4>
<p>If your HRP certification is revoked, you may choose one of the three following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take no action.</li>
<li>Submit a written request for reconsideration, which addresses the information or situation that initiated the concern, to the Manager. The written request must be sent by certified mail within 20 working days of receiving notice of the revocation. The Manager’s decision on the request for reconsideration is final.</li>
<li>Submit a written request for a certification review hearing to the Manager. The request must be sent by certified mail within 20 working days of receiving notice of the revocation. The Manager forwards the request to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, which will conduct a review hearing. The individual requesting the hearing has a right to appear personally, to present evidence through witnesses or by documents, and, at his or her own expense, to be represented and accompanied by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing. A transcript of the proceedings will be made. The Deputy Secretary's decision to either recertify or revoke HRP certification is final.</li>
