<strong> Superseding DOE-HDBK-1092-2004 (December 2004)</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the guidance contained in this Department of Energy (DOE) Handbook for Electrical Safety, DOE-HDBK-1092-2013, for implementing electrical safety at DOE facilities is based on well-developed industrial practices, mandatory rules, or nationally-recognized consensus codes or standards. The guidelines are written to be flexible, so that they encompass the range from large, permanent DOE test or production facilities to small research or testing facilities. These guidelines form a compendium of good practices and describe key elements of programs that support electrical safety at DOE facilities.</p>

<p>The purpose of this handbook is to facilitate, within the DOE, the performance of chemical process hazards analyses (PrHAs) as required under the PSM Rule. It provides basic information for the performance of PrHAs, and should not be considered a complete resource on PrHA methods. Likewise, to determine if a facility is covered by the PSM rule, the reader should refer to the handbook, ""Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals"" (DOE-HDBK-1101-2004).</p>

<p>During Fiscal Year 2001, the joint DOE/EFCOG Chemical Safety Topical Committee (CSTC) formed a team consisting of representatives from several sites and DOE headquarters to evaluate possible methods for integrating hazard analysis activities with potential overlap such as radiological, chemical, emergency preparedness, environmental and others. The CSTC Team identified and reviewed hazard analysis requirements and issues, collected numerous sources of good practices information and evaluated possible methods for integrating hazard analysis activities.</p>

The DOE ships various types of radioactive waste stemming from current and historical operations. Generally, candidate LSA material and SCO within the DOE complex are wastes generated from the clean-up and deactivation of World War II and Cold War era nuclear processing and weapons support operations. These waste matrices can be complex. The level of effort required to characterize waste varies based on the type and origin of waste being generated.</p>
