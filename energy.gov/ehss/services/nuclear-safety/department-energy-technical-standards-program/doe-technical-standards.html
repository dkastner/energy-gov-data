Conduct of operations includes those attitudes, processes, and precautions taken in the interest of safety. The exact features of a system of conduct of operations may be different at different activities. The common feature is a formality of operations which will vary in form and degree depending on the conditions and hazards of the activity. The most intensive application of conduct of operations would be found at the most hazardous activities subject to repetitive types of evolutions.<br />

<p>Why a DOE Chemical Management Handbook? Chemicals are ubiquitous in DOE’s nuclear and non-nuclear operations. Given their wide application, it is not surprising that chemical incidents or exposures continue at a rate of approximately one a day. With respect to major accidents, chemicals are the second leading cause of DOE Type A &amp; B accidents, exceeded only by those attributed to radiation.</p>

<strong>Replaced by DOE-STD-1090-2011</strong></p>
<p>The reissued June 1995 edition marked a change in classification. The DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) reclassified the manual as a handbook and it was issued as DOE Hoisting and Rigging Handbook (DOE-HDBK-1090-95). After further review, OSTI has reclassified the handbook as a DOE Technical Standard and the September 1996 edition was issued as DOE STANDARD HOISTING AND RIGGING (Formerly Hoisting and Rigging Manual) DOE-STD-1090-96 (Rev-1). Additional revisions issued are DOE-STD-1090-99, DOE-STD-1090-2001, DOE-STD-1090- 2004, and DOE-STD-1090-2007.</p>

<p>It is the policy of DOE to conduct its radiological operations in a manner that ensures the health and safety of all its employees, contractors, and the general public. In achieving this objective, the Department shall ensure that radiation exposures to its workers and the public and releases of radioactivity to the environment are maintained below regulatory limits and deliberate efforts are taken to further reduce exposures and releases as low as reasonably achievable. The Department is fully committed to implementing a radiological control program of the highest quality that consistently reflects this policy.</p>
