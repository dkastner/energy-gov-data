    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div  property="content:encoded" class="field-item odd"> <p>In FY 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy selected 38 new projects from across the nation under the Crosscutting Research Program that target innovative concepts and technologies to improve electric generating units and industrial plants that use fossil fuels. The selected projects support the Office of Fossil Energy’s Crosscutting Research Program’s initiatives in advanced energy systems.</p>
<p>The Crosscutting Research Program serves as a bridge between basic and applied research by targeting concepts that offer the potential for transformational breakthroughs and step-change benefits in the way energy systems are designed, constructed, and operated.</p>
<p>The 38 projects selected support 7 critical research areas in the Crosscutting Research Program as described below. Approximately $5.8 million of the project’s total value is provided via cost-share by research partners, in addition to $18.5 million in federal funds. FE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory will manage the projects.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative Concepts for Managing Water in Fossil-Fuel-Based Energy Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Institute of Gas Technology dba Gas Technology Institute (Des Plaines, Ill.)</em> — Simultaneous Waste Heat and Water Recovery from Power Plant Flue Gases for Advanced Energy Systems. The project team will further develop an existing transport membrane condenser (TMC) to increase water and energy recovery efficiency, at least double waste heat and water recovery performance, and lower its cost for power plant applications. Work on the project will be done in a TMC development, modeling, evaluation, and fabrication phase, and then proceed to a performance testing phase. The advanced TMC technology has the potential to reduce emissions and solid wastes by improving boiler efficiency and could potentially save $4.3 billion in water savings if applied to all U.S. power generation. (DOE share: $500,000; Recipient share: $130,000; Duration: 23 months)<br /> </li>
<li><em>Southern Company Services, Inc. (Birmingham, Ala.)</em> — Development of a Field Demonstration for Cost-Effective Low-Grade Heat Recovery and Use Technology Designed to Improve Efficiency and Reduce Water Usage Rates for a Coal-Fired Power Plant. In this project, an engineering study will be conducted as a prelude to a field demonstration of how low-grade waste heat can be used to reduce water usage rates and improve system efficiency in a coal-fired power plant. Researchers will survey U.S. coal generators on low-grade heat-recovery and low-grade heat use to develop a combination technology for pilot testing. The project will develop a plan to successfully perform a field demonstration of a cost-effective system for heat recovery and end use. (DOE share: $280,337; Recipient share: $141,807; Duration: 18 months)<br /> </li>
<li><em>Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, Pa.)</em> — Evaluating the Techno-Economic Feasibility of Forward Osmosis Process Utilizing Low Grade Heat: Applications in Power Plant Water, Wastewater, and Reclaimed Water Treatment. Using a series of heat recovery models and water treatment process models, this work will demonstrate the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of recovering low-temperature heat. The technology will be applied to water treatment at NETL model pulverized coal combustion, natural gas combined cycle, and integrated gasification combined cycle plants; and at Carnegie Mellon University’s industry partner plant (Plant Bowen). (DOE share: $499,536; Recipient share: $274,801; Duration: 23 months)<br /> </li>
<li><em>Porifera, Inc. (Hayward, Calif.)</em> — The COHO: Utilizing Low‐Grade Heat and CO2 at Power Plants for Water Treatment. This project will develop a water treatment system called COHOthat will be powered by low-grade heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) produced at power plants.
