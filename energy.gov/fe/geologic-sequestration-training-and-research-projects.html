<p>In September 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy announced more than $12.7 million in funding for geologic sequestration training and research projects. The 43 projects will offer training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students that will provide the human capital and skills required for implementing and deploying carbon capture and storage technologies.</p>
<p>The results of these projects (detailed below) will make a vital contribution to the scientific, technical, and institutional knowledge necessary to establish frameworks for the development of commercial CCS projects. These projects will produce a trained workforce necessary for the CCS industry with skills and competencies in geology, geophysics, geomechanics, geochemistry and reservoir engineering disciplines.</p>

<li><strong>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford, CA)</strong> - <em>Rock Physics of Geologic Carbon Sequestration/Storage</em>. This project will focus on the development of theoretical rock physics models that can predict the changes in the mineral framework of porous rock based on geological and geochemical circumstances and the resulting changes in its porosity; elastic properties; absolute and relative permeability; and electrical formation factor. These results will directly help in quantifying remote seismic and electrical data in terms of monitoring, verifying and accounting of CO2 and selecting formations most suitable for geologic CO2 sequestration. This work will be conducted by three doctoral students under the supervision of a teaching professor. By conducting fundamental research, these graduate students will acquire unique technical skills in quantifying changes in rock properties during injection and storage of CO2.</li>
<li><strong>Board of Trustees Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL)</strong> -<em> Risk Assessment and monitoring of Stored CO2 in Organic Rocks under Non-Equilibrium Conditions</em>. This project proposes novel experiments to evaluate the structural behavior of the Illinois Basin’s organic rocks under extreme transient conditions and to ascertain whether the dynamic stresses will overcome the adsorption forces holding CO2 in place. Six specific tasks are proposed to evaluate the structural and mechanical behavior of organic rocks under static, hydrostatic, and extreme dynamic stresses. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate and be trained in this project.</li>
<li><strong>Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (Champaign, IL)</strong> - <em>Understanding the Impact of CO2 Injection on the Subsurface Microbial Community in an Illinois Basin CCS Reservoir: Integrated Student Training in Geoscience and Geomicrobiology</em>. This project combines a research and teaching strategy to provide cross-disciplinary training opportunities in geology and geomicrobiology in the Department of Geology and the Institute of Genomic Biology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in the emerging field of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The project will take advantage of the unique opportunity provided by the drilling of CCS injection and monitoring wells, in conjunction with a Phase III large-scale CCS demonstration project operating at the Illinois Basin - Decatur Site in the Illinois Basin under the direction of the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC) and the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS)to collect samples both before and after injection of CO2, to observe how CO2 injection impacts the genetic composition of the subsurface microbial community. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate and be trained in this project.</li>
<li><strong>California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, CA)</strong> – <em>Molecular Simulation of Dissolved Inorganic Carbons for Underground Brine CO2 Sequestrations</em>. This project addresses the need to measure the Dissolved Inorganic Carbons (DIC) in underground brine water at higher sensitivity, lower cost, in situ, at higher frequency and over long periods of time for the monitoring, verification and accounting (MVA) of CO2 sequestration. This project will support at least 2 graduate students during the research effort.</li>
