<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Reporting Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Importers and exporters of natural gas must file monthly reports on their activities, as required in DOE/FE Order No. 2464, dated February 1, 2008.  Reports are required to contain certain information, but there is no requirement regarding the format for the monthly submissions.  The collection of this information is approved by OMB No. 1901-0294 which has an expiration date of 06/30/2019.  For the convenience of filers, the Office of Natural Gas Regulatory Activities provides formats for reporting information on Form FE-746R. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Filing Forms With The Federal Government And Estimated Reporting Burden</strong></p>
<p>Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information including suggestions for reducing this burden to: Energy Information Administration, Office of Survey Development and Statistical Integration, EI-21, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>General Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Send your reports to the Division of Natural Gas Regulatory Activities Docket Room:</p>
<p>Address:  </p>
<p>U.S. Department of Energy<br />Office of Fossil Energy<br />Attn:  Natural Gas Reports<br />FE-34; Room 3E-042<br />Forrestal Building<br />Washington, D.C.  20585</p>
<p>Phone:     202-586-7991<br />Fax:         202-586-6050<br />E-mail      <a href="mailto:ngreports@hq.doe.gov">ngreports@hq.doe.gov</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reports may be submitted as an attachment in an email, faxed, or sent by U.S. mail. EMAIL IS THE PREFERRED METHOD.  When submitting electronically, it is especially helpful if the report is attached in an Excel file.</p>
<p>Reports are due 30 days after the end of each month, or the first business day after if the 30th day falls on a holiday or weekend.<br />Reports must be filed even if there was no Import/Export activity.  In this case, a simple report indicating “No Activity” will suffice.<br />All reports, even those with no activity, should still include: company name; contact name, address, phone, fax and e-mail; docket and order numbers; and the reporting month.  Please, remember to also include this information on e-mailed reports.<br />Please contact the Import/Export Docket Room (<a href="mailto:ngreports@hq.doe.gov">ngreports@hq.doe.gov</a>) with comments or questions, or for assistance with your monthly report, if needed.</p>
<p><strong>MONTHLY REPORT FORM INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>There are thirty (30) different reporting formats, corresponding to different import and export activities.  If you choose to use one of the formats, please use the one that matches the activity you are reporting.  If you are reporting more than one kind of activity (e.g. both importing and exporting), please use different formats for each different activity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The thirty formats are contained in three groups, according to whether import/export activity is in gaseous (transportation by pipeline), liquid (transportation by vessel, truck, rail, or waterborne transport) or compressed gaseous transportation (vessel, truck, rail, or waterborne transport) form.  There is a separate form for import/export activity in specialized International Standards Organization (ISO) containers (vessel), which may contain liquid or compressed gas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The instructions below provide details on how to use each of the formats.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <strong> Natural Gas Imports (Pipeline)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Country of Origin:  Country from which natural gas is shipped to the U.S.  Typically, this is the country where the gas is produced from wells.</li>
<li>Point of Entry into U.S.:  Formal name of the border crossing point, which is typically an interconnection between a foreign pipeline and a U.S. pipeline.  List the U.S. side name.  See Table 1 for a list of point of entry / exits with the corresponding Canadian or Mexican point names.</li>
<li>Volume:  Enter the volume in thousand cubic feet (Mcf).  Make sure to list the volume at the border and not at the point of purchase, unless the purchase occurs at the border.  Provide separate volumes for each combination of point of entry, supplier, pipelines, and markets served.</li>
<li>Average Price at U.S. Border:  List the price in U.S. $/MMBtu at the border.  In other words, include the cost of foreign transportation, but do not include the cost of transportation within the U.S.  List the average price of each volume.</li>

<p>   <strong>In-Transit Natural Gas (Pipeline)</strong></p>
<p>In-Transit gas is gas that is transported through another country without being consumed there.  An example is gas that is imported from Canada into the U.S. at one border point and transported across the U.S. to another border point, where it is exported back to Canada, without being consumed in the U.S. Origin &amp; Final Destination Country (one country):  Since this is an in-transit transaction, the origin and final destination country should be the same.  The country may be the U.S. or another country.</p>
