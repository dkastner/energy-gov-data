<p>“Honoring our sacred trust with America’s Veterans means doing all we can to help them find work when they come home so they never feel as if the American Dream they fought to defend is out of reach for them and their families…It’s also about continuing to fill the ranks of federal employees with men and women who possess the skills, dedication, and sense of duty that Americans deserve from their public servants. And few embody those qualities like our nation’s Veterans.” <a href="operational-plan-and-desktop-reference-veterans-employment-initiative.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Over one million Veterans will return from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the demand for jobs has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy (DOE) is fully committed to the employment of our Nation’s returning service members, Veterans and their spouses. DOE’s commitment is communicated in Department-wide strategic plans and standard operating plans. The DOE Strategic Plan Goal 3, Strategic Objective 12 Attract, manage, train, and retain the best Federal workforce to meet mission needs states <em>“DOE faces serious workforce challenges over the coming decade, with 15 – 25 percent of its Federal employees projected to retire. </em>It further states that <em> “Efforts are underway to improve hiring quality and on-boarding processes and outcomes with a continued focus on promoting diversity and inclusion in the workforce.” </em> Annual Veteran hiring goals are established by senior leadership that are carried out through strategic objectives outlined in the “People” Section of the Human Capital Strategic Plan, and this document.</p>
<p>The mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) is to ensure America’s security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. To accomplish this mission, the Department’s workforce consists of over 13,600 Federal employees with expertise ranging from engineering, physics, mathematics, and climate science, to accounting, public policy, law, and professional administrative positions.</p>

<p><a href="operational-plan-and-desktop-reference-veterans-employment-initiative.html#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1">[1]</a> President Obama, White House Press Release November 9, 2009</p>
<h4><span>Purpose</span></h4>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide operational guidance on the Veterans Employment Initiative to human resources professionals, Administrative Officers, managers, and veterans. Goals and objectives are identified along with a number of options and sources designed to provide equal opportunity in the hiring, development, advancement, and retention of Veterans, and disabled Veterans across DOE. This is a living document that will be revised as necessary to maintain its effectiveness. It also integrates a strategic approach that serves as a guide for the Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program (DVAAP) Plan pursuant to section 403 of the Vietnam Era Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended (38 U.S.C. 2014); section 307 of the Civil Rights Reforms Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. 3112); and Title 5 CFR 720.304(c).</p>
<p>Continued success in executing the plan depends on the commitment of management, dedication of resources, and a collaborative approach that integrates elements of this Operational Plan with the organization’s current and future workforce planning strategies. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer utilized a collaborative approach in the development of the original Operational Plan obtaining input from representatives across the agency including: human resources offices; headquarters program offices; field sites; and Power Marketing Administrations. The plan incorporates ideas and recommendations for practices that would best serve management’s needs and those of our Veterans. Veteran employee groups are also engaged in the planning, execution, and integration of Veterans hiring and retention practices into human capital management processes and systems.</p>
<h4><span>Scope </span></h4>
<p>This guidance applies to all Departmental Elements including those that obtain HR services from outside of the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer.</p>
<p><strong><span>Veteran Employment Mission</span></strong><br /><em>Increase the employment of Veterans and returning service members within the Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration.</em></p>
<p><strong><span>Veteran Employment Vision</span></strong><br /><em>The Department of Energy demonstrates commitment to Veterans by identifying and promoting excellence in the recruitment, hiring, development, and retention of Veterans.  This vision is supported by educating Veterans and managers to best meet their needs.</em></p>
<p> <br />
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">KEY ELEMENTS OF THE VETERAN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROCESS</span><br />
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Recruitment</span>Over the last few years, the pool of Veterans has grown exponentially. This group of candidates is highly trained with an innate work ethic that complements DOE workforce needs. Despite all the hiring authorities and flexibilities designed to make it easier for Federal government to hire Veterans, it is often difficult to find just the right match.</p>
<p>Resources have been identified and tools are being established across government to further support the recruitment and hiring of Veterans. A number of tools are also being established within DOE to assist managers in attracting and hiring Veterans as outlined within the goals and objectives on pages 6 and 7. Managers are ultimately responsible for achieving these goals and must integrate Veteran recruitment strategies into recruitment plans. To assist in this process, information on Veteran recruitment sources has been provided in Appendix D and E.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer and servicing human resources offices will partner with management to help them achieve these goals. Annually, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer will organize and conduct a number of corporate Veteran and military recruitment activities to help managers attract talent. Program Offices should collaborate with their servicing HR office to actively participate whenever possible and integrate these sources into recruitment plans. The corporate events are expected to be supplemented by Veteran recruitment within the local areas including colleges and universities. Whenever possible, Veterans should accompany HR professionals to recruitment events. Veteran employment points-of-contact have been established within each of the program areas to provide valuable input into processes and strategies, and offer an additional level of service to Veterans. They collaborate with managers, human resources professionals, special employment program coordinators, and internal and external stakeholders on the recruitment and hiring of Veterans. For detailed information, see “Roles and Responsibilities” on pages 7-10.</p>
<p>Military, Veteran employment coordinators, and other Veteran groups are included in the list of sources who receive automated job announcements. Periodically, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer will review this list and update as necessary to remain current.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Best Practices in Recruitment</span><br />The Department’s ability to attract and retain top talent requires that the recruitment message resonate with the audience. Military service personnel are problem solvers and desire positions where they can continue their service to the Nation. Veterans are looking for challenging jobs with opportunity for development and advancement. Recruitment messages that resonate focus on the importance of the agency mission for the future of our country. Some marketing messages DOE will consider including through corporate marketing and within the local communities are<br />
<ul type="disc">
<li>DOE is committed to employee training</li>
<li>There are more Nobel Laureates in DOE than all other agencies combined</li>
<li>Veterans are valued within the DOE community</li>
<li>Every day brings challenges in DOE – your military experience will serve you well</li>
<li>Some of the most cutting-edge research and technology can be found within DOE and its National Laboratory System</li>
<li>DOE offers leadership training programs</li>
<li>Employees stay with DOE because of the people and dedication to the mission</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to building the right recruitment message, DOE must reach Veterans through the use of social networking sites where they spend much of their time. DOE servicing human resources offices will expand the use of social networking in collaboration with Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. LinkedIn is a site that enables candidates to locate job information through word search capabilities. Facebook and Twitter are used to build fun, interactive activities that will attract candidates by teaching them about the DOE mission. In the coming months, DOE expects to launch a new interactive game for mobile devices that will teach players about DOE mission areas.</p>
<p>Another best practice is to involve employees in the recruitment of Veterans. Employees understand the knowledge and skills necessary for the job and can be the best source of qualified Veterans. Bonneville Power Administration has instituted an awards program for employees who refer Veterans for hard-to-fill hourly positions. A portion of the award is given when the Veteran is hired and the remainder is awarded if the Veteran stays with the organization for one year.</p>
<p>Servicing HR offices can also locate highly qualified Veterans by collaborating with the local employment centers and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Employment Service Offices. These offices work with agencies to provide referrals of Veterans that are matched with job opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Job Matching</span> Until the Federal hiring process evolves to meet current needs, the burden for matching Veterans with career opportunities rests with the human resources professional. Many Veterans have limited knowledge and understanding of the complexities of the Federal hiring process. Without guidance, job applications often do not reflect the Veteran’s knowledge, skills, and abilities as they relate to Federal positions. This results in many Veterans having difficulty in finding jobs that match their skills and aspirations. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs established a website to assist Veterans in writing their resume in civilian terms at: <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.vetsuccess.simplicity.com.html" rel="nofollow">www.vetsuccess.simplicity.com</a>.</p>
<p>Human resource professionals and Veteran points-of-contact within the DOE/NNSA program areas must be prepared to offer guidance and informational resources as needed to assist the Veteran in better positioning themselves for the right career opportunities and navigating the hiring process.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Removing Barriers</span> As identified on page 4, there are a number of barriers both real and perceived to the employment of Veterans. Many of the goals and objectives established in this plan were designed to remove barriers. With collaboration, proper planning and the broad use of available resources, many of these obstacles can and should be eliminated. Managers should work with the local Diversity Office to resolve barriers, both real and perceived.</p>
<p>All too often DOE career opportunities are of a scientific and highly technical nature that requires specialized skills and educational requirements. For certain highly technical positions, candidate pools are limited and competition for talent is high. For this reason, substantial effort and pre-planning must take place that results in a list of the highest qualified candidates for the position. The Richland Operations Office has found that when human resources professionals partner with hiring managers to clearly define the position, skills needed, and selective placement factor questions, the referred Veterans are well qualified for the positions. As a result, managers want to hire the Veteran because their job skills are complemented by dedication and a highly valued work ethic.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Encourage Veterans to Apply</span> All vacancy announcements, student employment, and internship opportunities that represent an opportunity for Veterans must include a statement encouraging Veterans to apply.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Increased Use of Hiring Flexibilities</span>Human resources professionals should educate and encourage managers in the use of hiring authorities and flexibilities to improve the time it takes to hire talent. For more information see the FedsHireVets website: <a href="http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shav/index.aspx#vra">http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shav/index.aspx#vra</a>.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Relatives</span> A relative may work in the same agency with an employee when there is no direct reporting relationship and the employee is not in a position to influence or control the relative’s appointment, employment, promotion or advancement within the agency (see 5 CFR 362.105 (f)). In addition, rules of impartiality in performing official duties and ethics apply. For additional information about these regulations you may visit <a href="http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Use-of-Government-Position-and-Resources/Remaining-Impartial/">http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Use-of-Government-Position-and-Resources/Remai...</a> .</div>
<div class="ready-accordion">  <span class="ready-accordion-header">Reasonable Accommodation</span>
<p>In accordance with regulation, before bringing on a Veteran with disabilities, managers must determine and address any known need for reasonable accommodation. Inquiries should relate only to the accommodation necessary to successfully perform the job and not the condition or how it was obtained. “Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the ADA), requires an employer<sup></sup>to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause undue hardship. ”</p>
<p>"In general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities."</p>
<p>There are three categories of "reasonable accommodations":</p>
<p>"(i) modifications or adjustments to a job application process that enable a qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such qualified applicant desires; or<br />(ii) modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position; or<br />(iii) modifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities."
<p>Reasonable accommodation is available to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities through the employee accommodations programs managed within the Office of Chief Human Capital Officer. Information on the Headquarters Accommodation Program can be found at: <a href="wellness-program/headquarters-accomodation-program.html"> http://energy.gov/hc/wellness-program/headquarters-accomodation-program </a> . Reasonable accommodations must be provided to qualified employees regardless of whether they work part-time or full-time, or are considered "probationary." Generally, the individual with a disability must inform the employer that an accommodation is needed. For more information on reasonable accommodation, see: <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Orientation</span>
<p>The DOE orientation is available online at: <a href="services/new-employee-orientation.1.html">http://energy.gov/hc/services/new-employee-orientation</a> . Following the DOE orientation, it is important for the assigned office to provide an orientation for new employees, including Veterans. The office orientation will help acclimate the employee to the office and offers greater opportunity for success. Be prepared to discuss the mission of the office and its program areas, office environment and management expectations, offer information on where to find available resources, and introduce the staff. Suggested topics for a discussion with the immediate supervisor should include: a review of the job requirements; explanation of the performance evaluation process; and a question and answer session. A one-year onboarding program is being developed to integrate new employees into their organization. The program will provide employees with the tools, resources, and knowledge to become successful and productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Mentoring</span>
<p>Each Veteran new hire below the full performance level will be assigned a mentor to offer individualized assistance. A mentor can help them quickly assimilate into the DOE environment and become a highly effective member of the workforce. The mentor should be someone other than the supervisor who can answer day-to-day questions and provide that essential link between training and real life application. Mentored employees have a stronger commitment to the organization and are less likely to leave. While many employees expect to change jobs within 2 to 3 years, this timeframe can often be extended with good coaching and mentoring. According to information provided by the Value of A Veteran Consulting Service, coaching and mentoring is especially important in the retention of Veterans. Whenever possible, this should be another Veteran within the program office who can identify with the needs of the new Veteran.</p>
<p>Check with your local training office for a mentoring program that can provide an additional level of mentoring. In Headquarters, the Office of Learning and Workforce Development (HC-20) manages the Department’s Mentoring Program and is available to work with your office to match Veterans with mentors. For the Mentoring Program Guide, and Tools for the mentor and mentee, see:<a href="https://energy.gov/hc/mentoring-program">http://energy.gov/hc/mentoring-program</a>. In addition, the Office of Personnel Management 2008 booklet Best Practices in Mentoring can be found at: <a href="http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/training-and-development/career-development/bestpractices-mentoring.pdf">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/training-and-development/career...</a> .</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Social Networking and Mobile Technology</span> A new level of transparency has been created within government and the use of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have changed the way we communicate. The use of mobile technology and social media sites is commonplace in the search for job information. Progressive organizations are using social media and mobile technology to stimulate conversation and community around their products and services. For example, the LinkedIn job board received the most visits and is one of the most used job boards in recruitment. DOE uses social media sites to expand outreach to Veterans and affinity groups.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer has implemented the use social media sites including: Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn for the purpose of marketing DOE and attracting top talent. Information of importance for Veterans has been shared. This is particularly important since the military is accustomed to utilizing electronic communication for their day-to-day operations. Whenever these capabilities are established within DOE elements, use of social media and mobile technology for marketing and recruitment is encouraged to assist managers to attract and retain top talent.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Opportunities for Socializing</span>Positive business impact and retention result from enabling collaboration and fostering community among employees. Managers are encouraged to provide opportunities for Veterans to participate in outside Veteran activities and collaborate with the local Department of Energy Veteran employee group. These practices help to establish a broader knowledge base, and often result in increased confidence and job satisfaction.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Training and Development</span>DOE policy stipulates that employees will have Individual Development Plans (IDP). Managers will offer additional assistance, as needed for Veteran employees to establish an IDP that addresses their individual skills gaps and helps to prepare them for advancement opportunities. A broad range of developmental options including participation in leadership development programs must be integrated into succession planning and IDPs to enhance the knowledge and skills of all employees. Where training resources are limited, look for low or no cost options. Consult your local training administrator for assistance.</p>
<p>Headquarters offices desiring to establish a training (intern) program specifically for Veterans may contact the Office of Learning and Workforce Development (HC-20) for guidance. Training consultants can also provide assistance Veterans and managers to identify DOE training opportunities that will meet skills needs. Offices outside of Headquarters should consult their local training office for information and assistance.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Monitoring Progress</span>DOE Order 331.1C, Employee Performance Management and Recognition Program established requirements and responsibilities for performance management at GS-15 and below, or equivalent. In addition to these requirements, good management practices include frequent on-going communication with the employee. Progress should be monitored throughout the year as opposed to only when performance evaluations are due. Through regular observation and feedback, managers can increase employee motivation and success. Communications become stronger and the employee is given an opportunity to provide input. Employees who feel they have contributed to the mission are generally more enthusiastic and motivated. More importantly, frequent interactions allow management to identify barriers and obstacles to the employee’s success, and address these issues through timely adjustments of resources, training, or assignments. This is particularly important in the case of Veterans with disabilities.</p>
<p>In addition, frequent communication creates opportunities for managers to provide timely, informal recognition for a job well done, outside of the formal awards process. This contributes to a higher level of job satisfaction, performance and retention.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">Program Evaluation</span>
<p><strong><em>Program Performance Measures</em></strong></p>

<h4><span>Five Key Focus Areas</span></h4>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>“The Department of Energy Operational Plan and Desktop Reference for the Veterans Employment Initiative”</em> aligns with the following five key areas as outlined in the Executive Order for the Employment of Veterans in the Federal Government and “ <em>The Government-wide Veterans’ Recruitment and Employment Strategic Plan for FY 2014 – FY 2017.”</em> The DOE plan provides the strategic framework necessary for organizations across the Department to reach, attract, and hire Veterans with the right skills and career aspirations to meet our workforce needs. Focused attention, resources and tools have been established in each of the five areas. Achievements and progress in each of these areas aid DOE organizations as well as Veterans in finding the right job match.</p>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">1. Leadership Commitment</span>

<h4>Intergrating Veteran Employment Options and Strategies</h4>
<p>Numerous Veteran hiring flexibilities exist and use of these options is encouraged to meet workforce needs across the Department. An organization may select one or more that best meets their needs in attracting Veterans into their workforce. Use of the flexibilities must contribute to a fair, equitable and transparent process. Additional information on Veterans Preference and the special appointment authorities listed in the table below may be found in the Vet Guide developed by the Office of Personnel Management:<a href="http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide/%20">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide/</a>, and through available online training videos in the Online Learning Center (OLC) accessed through Employee Self Service.</p>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">VETERANS PREFERENCE</span>Please refer to this <a href="https://fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/index.aspx">webpage</a> for the most current information pertaining to veteran preference. <br />
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">5 Point Preference</span>If a Veteran served during specific periods of conflict in the armed forces, including 1941 to 1955, 180 consecutive days from 1955 to 1976, during the Gulf War from 1990 to 1992 or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized, including El Salvador, Grenada, Haiti, Lebanon, Panama, Somalia, Southwest Asia, Bosnia and the Global War on Terrorism, they are eligible for a 5 point preference. For Veterans who are not disabled, in addition to service, medal holders or Gulf War Veterans who joined after a specific date must have served for 24 months or the full amount of time required for active duty to be eligible for the 5 point preference.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">10 Point Preference </span><br />A Veteran who has a service connected disability, received a Purple Heart or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits or a pension from the military or the Department of Veteran Affairs may qualify for a 10 point preference. Others may claim this preference, including unmarried spouses of deceased Veterans, spouses of Veterans unable to work because of a service-connected disability or mothers of Veterans who died in service or who are permanently and totally disabled.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Family Member Preference</span><br />Derived Preference is a method where the spouse, widow/widower, or mother of a Veteran may be eligible to claim Veterans' preference when the Veteran is unable to use it. XP Preference (10 points) is given in appointment as long as eligibility criteria are met.Preference may be derived when the Veteran is unemployed and:
<p>• Is rated by appropriate military or Department of Veterans Affairs authorities to be 100 percent disabled and/or unemployable; or<br />• Has retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position on the basis of a disability that is service-connected in origin; or<br />• Has attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of his or her usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected   disability.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/familypref/index.aspx">http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/familypref/index.aspx</a> and 5 CFR Parts 315 and 316, RIN Number 3206-AL73, for more information on family member preference.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">0 Point Sole Survivor Preferance</span><br />Sole Survivor Preference 6 U.S.C. 2108(3)(H)<br />Military service members released or discharged from active duty in the armed forces after August 29, 2008, by reason of “a sole survivorship discharge.” The active duty member may request separation pursuant to Department of Defense policy permitting early separation for individuals who are the only surviving child in a family in which the father or mother or one or more siblings:<br />• Served in the armed forces and<br />• Was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization)<br />• Where the death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.
<p>Under sole survivorship preference the individual does not receive points under “rule of three; is entitled to be considered after other preference eligibles and ahead of non-preference eligibles in category rating; is entitled to receive the same pass over rights as other preference eligibles; and is entitled to credit military experience to meet qualification requirements for Federal jobs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act of 2011</span>The Act requires Federal agencies to treat certain active duty service members as preference eligibles for appointments in the competitive service. Service members who submit a “certification” when applying for a job are to be treated as preference eligibles under Section 2108. A “certification” is any written document from the armed forces that certifies the service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service in the armed forces under honorable conditions not later than 120 days after the date the certification is submitted. Verification that the service member meets the definition of a “preference eligible” under 5 U.S.C. § 2108 must be made prior to appointment.</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">SPECIAL APPOINTMENT AUTHORITIES</span>
<p> In addition to Veterans’ preference, managers are encouraged to use special appointment authorities that are available to streamline the recruitment and hiring of Veterans. The following table provides a quick glimpse of these authorities. For a better understanding of these authorities, <em>Veterans Employment Training for Hiring Managers</em>; and <em>Veterans Employment Training for Human Resources Professionals</em> courses are available through the DOE On-Line Learning Center: <a href="https://olc.energy.gov/learning/user/login.jsp">https://olc.energy.gov/learning/user/login.jsp</a>. HR Professionals and Hiring Managers across the Department are required to take the appropriate course annually.</p>
