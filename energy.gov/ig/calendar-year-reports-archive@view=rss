&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The National Nuclear Security Administration’s Weapons Evaluation Test Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary mission of the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.  NNSA’s stockpile surveillance program continuously assesses and evaluates each nuclear weapon system to detect or anticipate any potential problems. Sandia National Laboratories’ (Sandia) Weapons Evaluation Test Laboratory (WETL), located at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas, supports the execution of the stockpile surveillance program by testing weapon functionality and providing quality data to support NNSA’s annual stockpile assessments.  Specifically, WETL performs laboratory testing using centrifuges and other test equipment.  The non-nuclear components are mounted on a centrifuge and exposed to environments that simulate the launch and reentry conditions.  Funding for Sandia’s laboratory testing program totaled about $62 million for fiscal years (FY) 2012 through 2015, including $15.8 million for WETL operations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, the Office of Inspector General received an anonymous complaint regarding the management of Sandia’s Integrated Stockpile Evaluation Group.  The complaint alleged that Sandia diverted equipment to other programs and failed to fund preventive maintenance for WETL.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our audit did not substantiate the allegation that Sandia diverted equipment to other programs.  Because the allegation contained no specifics, we focused our review on equipment in the year that the complaint was received.  Specifically, we verified that all FY 2013 equipment purchases over $25,000 and most purchases of sensitive items (cell phones and computing assets) were reflected in the WETL property list.  In addition, an FY 2015 wall-to-wall property inventory performed by Sandia every 4 years found no missing items purchased for WETL in FY 2013.  Furthermore, we interviewed all WETL technologists on staff for August and October 2015, and the technologists indicated no concerns regarding equipment diversion.  Although some officials expressed concern to us about the adverse impact of constrained budgets on maintenance, we did not identify specific instances where Sandia failed to fund maintenance at WETL.   However, we found that Sandia had not met NNSA’s expectations for laboratory testing at WETL.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplanned downtime for the testing equipment at WETL created major disruptions to testing operations and contributed, in large part, to the failure to meet baseline testing goals. The primary factor contributing to the unplanned equipment downtime was a nearly 2-year outage of the large centrifuge dedicated to testing Navy weapon systems.  The outage was due to noise and vibration issues, followed by an unrelated fire in the drive system.  In addition, Sandia’s actions to consolidate explosives operations have affected testing at WETL.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient execution of WETL laboratory tests is critical to identifying stockpile defects in a timely manner to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile.  Although Sandia anticipates that it will eliminate the WETL test backlog by April 2017, because of the age and uniqueness of the centrifuges, we believe there is an increased risk of further operational delays and unplanned equipment outages.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Assessment Report: OAI-V-17-01</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/ig/downloads/assessment-report-oai-v-17-01</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/ig/downloads/assessment-report-oai-v-17-01&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assessment Report: OAI-V-17-01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;January 3, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit Coverage of Cost Allowability for Jefferson Science Associates LLC During Fiscal Years 2011 - 2014 Under Department of Energy Contract No. DE-AC05-06OR23177 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson Science Associates, LLC (JSA) has managed and operated Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) since April 2006.  JSA is a partnership between Southeastern Universities Research Association and PAE Applied Technologies that contracts with the Department of Energy.  Jefferson Lab, part of the Department’s Office of Science, provides a nuclear physics user facility to enable the international user community to conduct scientific research.  During fiscal years (FYs) 2011 through 2014, JSA incurred and claimed costs of $709,106,083.54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSA is required by its contract to account for all funds advanced by the Department annually on its Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed, to safeguard assets in its care, and to claim only allowable costs.  The Department’s Cooperative Audit Strategy (Strategy) makes efficient use of available audit resources while ensuring that the Department’s contractors claim only allowable costs.    The Strategy places reliance on the contractors’ internal audit function (Internal Audit) to provide audit coverage of the allowability of incurred costs that are claimed by contractors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our assessment, nothing came to our attention to indicate that the allowable cost-related audit work performed by JSA’s Internal Audit could not be relied upon.  We did not identify any material control weaknesses with the cost allowability audits, which generally met Institute of Internal Auditors.  We noted improvements in Internal Audit’s work on engagement planning, work paper documentation, and supervision issues identified in our previous assessment.  Additionally, we found that JSA generally arranged for audits of subcontractors when costs incurred were a factor in determining the amount payable to a subcontractor.  Specifically, JSA had 16 active cost-reimbursable subcontracts valued at approximately $11 million during our review.  We found that JSA arranged for an audit of 1 commercial subcontract and obtained results for audits conducted under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations, for the remaining 15 cost reimbursable subcontracts with universities.  Finally, JSA’s Internal Audit identified $26,672.23 in questioned costs as part of its allowable cost audits and other reviews in FYs 2011 through 2014, of which $5,031 identified during the audit of the commercial subcontract had not been resolved.  Therefore, we are questioning this amount.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Audit Report: DOE-OIG-17-03</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/ig/downloads/audit-report-doe-oig-17-03</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/ig/downloads/audit-report-doe-oig-17-03&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Audit Report: DOE-OIG-17-03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;December 29, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonneville Power Administration’s Contractor Workforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville) markets wholesale electrical power produced primarily from Federal hydro projects in the Pacific Northwest.  In 2015, Bonneville’s workforce consisted of approximately 3,000 Federal employees and approximately 3,100 contract workers.  Bonneville acquires its contractor workforce through service contracts that directly engage the time and effort of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform a task rather than furnish a product.  In March 2015, the Office of Inspector General received a hotline complaint alleging contract, labor, and management irregularities at Bonneville, including the establishment of prohibited personal services contracts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that Bonneville had not always effectively and efficiently managed its contractor workforce.  Specifically, based on the results of our judgmental sample of 20 of the 3,117 contract workers, review of documentation related to Bonneville’s procurement of contract workers, and interviews with key personnel, we found that Bonneville had created prohibited personal services contracts by establishing improper employer/employee relationships with supplemental labor workers, one category of its contractor workforce.  Further, a risk that contract workers were inappropriately performing inherently governmental and critical work that should be reserved for Federal employees existed.  We also found weaknesses in Bonneville’s acquisition and administration of services contracts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, our conclusions concerning personal services contracts substantiated one of the allegations included in the hotline complaint.  However, we were not able or did not substantiate the other allegations included in the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues we identified occurred, in part, because of problems with the manner in which Bonneville managed and implemented its supplemental labor category of contract workers, lack of a strategic workforce plan, insufficient management and oversight of its contractor workforce, and an inadequate procurement control environment.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Audit Report: OAI-M-17-03</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/ig/downloads/audit-report-oai-m-17-03</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/ig/downloads/audit-report-oai-m-17-03&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Audit Report: OAI-M-17-03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;December 23, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followup Audit of the Department’s Heavy Water Inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) inventory of heavy water is a vital national security asset.  Heavy water, primarily managed and stored at the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12), is used in NNSA Weapons Activities to produce parts for weapons system life extension programs and to support National Ignition Facility (NIF) nuclear weapon design and simulation missions.  Additional heavy water inventories are located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, used primarily for non-Weapons Activities such as Spallation Neutron Source research and development, and at the Savannah River Site, which maintains an inventory unusable for current programs and planned for future disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2008, our report on Nuclear Weapons Programs Heavy Water Inventory (DOE/IG-0798) identified the need to secure new sources of heavy water because the inventory was likely to be depleted by 2019.  Management agreed with the prior report, and in response, a heavy water assessment was completed in 2009 that defined options to meet heavy water requirements.  In 2010, the Department obtained additional heavy water from the Department of Defense.  Also, NNSA officials told us that they had not been supplying heavy water to non-Weapons Activities, essentially establishing a reserve for NNSA missions, although an NNSA official said they would consider requests from other programs under certain circumstances.  In 2012, Y-12 replaced its traditional production process for lithium deuteride weapons parts, which required heavy water, with the Direct Material Manufacturing process, which recycles these weapons parts and significantly decreased the demand for heavy water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our followup audit on the Department’s management of its inventory of heavy water, we determined that, while the Department had taken several actions to address heavy water requirements to meet mission needs through fiscal year (FY) 2031, management of the heavy water inventory may not ensure a sufficient supply for Weapons Activities beyond that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Department officials, actions to address Weapons Activities heavy water requirements after FY 2031 were not taken because, based on Nuclear Materials Management forecasts developed in 2012, when Y-12 fully implemented the Direct Material Manufacturing process, the Department determined that the heavy water inventory was adequate to meet program requirements through FY 2031 and beyond, which would afford sufficient time to prepare plans to meet needs beyond that date.  Thus, the Department did not have any concerns regarding the long-term availability of heavy water.  Therefore, the Department had not established a point, such as an inventory level or other trigger point, when it would begin to pursue other options for acquiring heavy water for Weapons Activities.  However, given the uncertainty of heavy water requirements beyond 2031, the long lead time to establish a production capability, and the estimated lead time to develop recycle or re-enrichment capabilities, the Department may be at risk of being unable to meet all of its Weapons Activities heavy water requirements in the long term.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Audit Report: OAI-M-17-02</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/ig/downloads/audit-report-oai-m-17-02</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/ig/downloads/audit-report-oai-m-17-02&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Audit Report: OAI-M-17-02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;December 15, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followup on the Department of Energy’s Analytical Services Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy’s Analytical Services Program ensures that the data acquired from commercial analytical environmental laboratories are valid, reliable, and defensible.  The program also ensures that the treatment and disposal of the Department’s low-level radioactive and mixed waste are in accordance with all applicable regulations and in a manner protective of human health and the environment.  The Analytical Services Program is a corporate program, servicing all Department program line organizations, including the National Nuclear Security Administration.  The Department expended more than $70 million during fiscal year (FY) 2016 for contracted services at commercial environmental analytical laboratories and waste management treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior report on the Audit of the Department of Energy’s Commercial Laboratory Quality Assurance Evaluation Program (IG-0374, June 1995) disclosed that contractors conducted redundant quality assurance evaluations of commercial laboratories, produced inconsistent results, and did not communicate those results to contractors.  In fact, the report noted that 103 of the 206 quality assurance evaluations reviewed were redundant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our followup audit, we found that the Department had taken corrective actions to address the issues identified in our 1995 report.  We did not identify any redundant audits of commercial analytical laboratories, as previously identified, nor did we identify any redundant audits of TSDFs.  We also found processes in place to ensure consistent results and the communication of those results throughout the Department.  For example, the Department of Energy’s Consolidated Audit Program (DOECAP) shares audit results and program information with Department sites, commercial laboratories, and TSDFs.  In response to our prior recommendations, the Department created the Analytical Services Program, which consists of three component elements:  DOECAP, the Mixed Analyte Performance Evaluation Program, and the Visual Sample Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing came to our attention indicating that the Department was not managing the three program components effectively and efficiently.  However, we identified one area that requires management’s attention.  We found that DOECAP auditors did not always properly handle sensitive unclassified information and used personally owned devices to access, store, and potentially transmit information categorized and marked as Official Use Only (OUO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auditors were using personal computers because of restrictions that their sites had placed on access to the Universal Serial Bus ports, commonly referred to as USB ports, on Government-issued laptops.  The Analytical Services Program manager has acknowledged that the use of personally owned devices is an issue throughout the program.  Furthermore, officials stated that the use of personal email to transmit OUO information was possible.  In fact, we identified multiple instances where information marked OUO was sent to a non-Government email address.  Using personal email circumvents the Department’s automated information system, which is used to transmit and store official email and prevents access to OUO information by persons who do not require the information to perform their jobs or other Department-authorized activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Statement Audit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report presents the results of the independent certified public accountants’ audit of the balance sheets of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission), as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of net cost, changes in net position, budgetary resources, and custodial activity for the years then ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fulfill Office of Inspector General audit responsibilities, we contracted with the independent public accounting firm of KPMG LLP (KPMG) to conduct the audit, subject to our review.  KPMG concluded that the combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the Commission as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and its net costs, changes in net position, budgetary resources, and custodial activities for the years then ended, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic: Management &amp;amp; Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Special Report: OIG-SR-17-03</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/ig/downloads/special-report-oig-sr-17-03</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/ig/downloads/special-report-oig-sr-17-03&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special Report: OIG-SR-17-03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 29, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Department of Energy’s Readiness to Implement the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014&lt;/em&gt; (DATA Act), enacted on May 9, 2014, required Federal agencies to report on financial and payment data elements in accordance with standards established by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  Agency reported data will be made available to taxpayers and other stakeholders on a Web site operated by Treasury in consultation with OMB.  To assist agencies with the implementation of DATA Act requirements, Treasury and OMB developed an eight-step process to streamline implementation efforts.  The process included, among other things, organization of a DATA Act working group, inventory of existing agency data, and implementation of needed changes to information technology systems and business processes to capture required data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DATA Act also required each Office of Inspector General (OIG) to report on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of data and the use of data standards by their cognizant agency.  In preparation for the initial report to be issued by November 2017, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) encouraged the OIG community to undertake DATA Act “readiness reviews” using the &lt;em&gt;Data Act Readiness Review Guide&lt;/em&gt; developed by the Federal Audit Executive Council, a component of CIGIE.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our review of the Department’s progress implementing the DATA Act did not identify any significant weaknesses and noted that the Department appeared to be on track to meet the requirements of the DATA Act.  We also found that the Department had made significant progress addressing the elements included in the Treasury/OMB eight-step implementation process.  Specifically, we determined that the Department had taken action to address each of the planning steps included in the DATA Act readiness review guidance and was well-positioned to execute and implement goals within the required timeframes.  In addition, while the potential exists that the requirements may change, the Department’s actions to date have positioned it to successfully execute the requirements of the DATA Act.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Audit Report: OAI-L-17-03</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/ig/downloads/audit-report-oai-l-17-03</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/ig/downloads/audit-report-oai-l-17-03&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Audit Report: OAI-L-17-03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 17, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Energy Contractors’ Implementation of Earned Value Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy uses Earned Value Management (EVM) as a project management tool to measure the value of completed work against the planned work schedule and estimated cost.  The Office of Management and Budget requires Government EVM systems to comply with the guidelines found in the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) publication 748.  The Department’s Office of Project Management Oversight and Assessments (PM) is responsible for ensuring that contractors’ EVM systems comply with EIA-748 guidelines.  PM uses the Department’s Project Assessment and Reporting System (PARS II) as the Department’s central repository and system of record for contractor’s EVM cost and schedule performance data.  Contractors also use their own corporate project management systems from which they feed data into PARS II through electronic uploads on a monthly basis.  As of July 2015, the Department’s contractors had 29 post Critical Decision (CD) 2 capital asset projects worth approximately $25 billion that were required to use EVM systems to track and manage project performance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To its credit, PM has identified deficiencies with the contractors implementing EVM.  During our audit, we observed that reviews of some contractors’ EVM systems were delayed; however, we noted that PM was taking corrective actions.  PM officials told us that two contractors did not have certified EVM systems because their EVM systems were deemed significantly noncompliant with EIA-748 based on reviews for cause (RFC).  In addition, despite having certified systems, two contractors were reporting what is potentially incomplete and unreliable EVM data to the Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also noted that PM was late in performing surveillance reviews for the EVM systems of six contractors with projects that had over $100 million in total project costs.  PM did not perform the reviews within the timeframes that were in effect at the time of our audit as specified in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets.   However, in May 2016, the Department modified DOE Order 413.3B, removing the requirement for reviews every 2 years and replacing the reviews with a “risk-based, data-driven” assessment.  When discussing our concerns regarding delays in performing surveillance reviews, PM officials stated that, in practice, they began implementing the risk-based, data-driven approach prior to the revision of the DOE Order, consistent with a Secretarial policy direction issued in June 2015.  In addition, we found PM was taking steps to improve project reporting by upgrading the PARS II database; the upgrades are scheduled for completion in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficiencies we observed, if not corrected, could significantly affect the Department’s ability to properly manage its projects.  Without certifying compliance with EIA-748 and conducting surveillance reviews to ensure that contractors properly implement their certified EVM systems, the Department cannot ensure that the EVM data it receives from the contractors are reliable. Granting concessions from EVM reporting to troubled projects further impedes Department decision makers. &lt;/p&gt;
