    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div  property="content:encoded" class="field-item odd"> <p>Randy Manion:           Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you may be, and welcome to the fifth webinar of the 2016 DOE Tribal Renewable Energy webinar series. Today's webinar, "Tribal Business Structure for Financing Projects." I'm Randy Manion, today's webinar chair, and manager of Western Area Power Administration's Renewable Resource Program.</p>
<p>Let's go over some event details first. Today's webinar is being recorded and will be made available on DOE's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Program's website, along with copies of today's PowerPoint presentations, in about one week. Everyone will receive a post-webinar email with the link to the page where the slides and recording will be located.</p>
<p>Because we are recording this webinar, all phones have been muted for this purpose, and we'll answer your questions at the end of everyone's presentation, so at the end of the webinar. However, you can submit a question at any time, clicking on the question button located in the webinar control box on your screen, and type in your question. If you've entered your audio PIN, if we have time at the end of the webinar, we'll unmute the line so you can raise your hand and ask the panel a question directly.</p>
<p>And also, one thing I'd like to add here, we sent out the wrong link last week for the webinar recording, so the link that you'll receive for this webinar tomorrow will have all the past webinars that we've done this year and previously. You can access them through the link that you'll receive tomorrow.</p>
<p>We'll try to keep the webinar to no more than 90 minutes, but we have quite a few speakers today, so there's a good chance we'll probably go to a full two hours. And so with that, let's get started with opening remarks from Lizana Pierce.</p>
<p>Lizana is a program manager in the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, duty stationed in Golden, Colorado. Lizana is responsible for implementing national funding and financing programs and administering the resultant tribal energy project grants and agreements. She has more than 20 years of clean energy technology project development and management experience, assisting tribes in developing their energy resources and building their energy visions. She holds a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from Colorado State University, and pursued a master's in business administration through the University of Northern Colorado. Lizana, it's a pleasure to have you here to do the opening remarks, and the virtual floor is all yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Thank you, Randy. Hello, everyone. I join Randy in welcoming you to the fifth webinar of the 2016 series. This webinar series is sponsored by two US Department of Energy organizations, the Office of Indian Energy and Western Area Power Administration. The series is designed to promote tribal energy sufficiency and to foster economic development and employment on tribal lands using renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. The Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs directs, fosters, coordinates, and implements energy planning, education, management, and programs to assist tribes with energy development, capacity building, energy infrastructure, energy costs, and electrification of Indian lands and homes.</p>
<p>To provide this assistance, we work within the department, across government agencies, and with Indian tribes and organizations to promote Indian energy policies and initiatives and help Indian tribes overcome the barriers of developing and deploying energy solutions suited to their specific needs.</p>
<p>To help tribes overcome barriers, the Office of Indian Energy has developed several programmatic initiatives and partnerships. This renewable energy webinar series is one example of the type of education capacity building efforts that we offer. Today, you'll learn about six different structures available to tribes to diversity their economic portfolios by creating corporate structures for their energy businesses. No single structure will work for every tribe or even every tribally owned business. Each business structure has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Hopefully, through the information examples shared today, you will be more informed as to how to select the best structure to fit your tribe's goals, and additionally, today, you will have speakers addressing how to secure USDA and DOE funding to support project development and deployment, once you've established your business plan.</p>
<p>After today, we will have another six webinars remaining in the series. Each new webinar builds upon the previous webinars, with the foundation being strategic energy planning. In each of the 2016 monthly webinars, we've tried to include tribal case studies and information and hands on tools that you can use for your energy development efforts. We'd love any feedback you have on this webinar series.</p>
<p>But before I turn this back over to Randy, I wanted to remind people of an upcoming deadline. On January 9, 2014, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the administration to conduct quadrennial energy reviews. Informed by the June 2013 President's Climate Action Plan, and in response to a 2011 recommendation by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the administration-wide QER enables the federal government to translate policy goals into a set of analytically based integrated actions for executive actions, legislative proposals, and budget and resource requirements for proposed investments over a four year planning horizon.</p>
<p>The Secretary of Energy provides support to the QER task force, including coordination of activities related to the preparation of the QER report, policy analysis, modeling, and stakeholder engagement. So tribes are encouraged to submit comments on or about the QER and to get involved. You can submit your comments through DOE's website by Googling Department of Energy and QER. Your written comments will help – may help shape the recommendations for future energy policy. So we encourage you to consider getting involved.</p>
<p>And now I'd like to turn the virtual floor back over to Randy. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you. Thank you, Lizana. And our next speakers today are Doug MacCourt, Jonathan Claffey, Michael Castello, Deborah DeForge, Steven Estrada, and Bob Parkins, and I'll introduce them all now, and we'll start with Doug.</p>
<p>Doug MacCourt is policy advisor to the director and staff of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs and works throughout DOE with other federal and state agencies on policy, legislative, and funding issues that are critical to the office's mission of developing and deploying clean energy and related economic development programs in Indian County. He has more than 25 years of experience working with tribes, Alaska native corporations, and tribal business enterprises on all aspects of energy development and natural resource matters. Doug published the Renewable Energy Development in Indian Country, a handbook for tribes, and is listed in the Chambers USA America's Leading Lawyers for Business and Best Lawyers in America for Native American and natural resources law. Prior to joining DOE, he was a partner in the Portland office of Ater Wynne, where he created the firm's Native American group and led the land use and redevelopment practice in the firm's business group.</p>
<p>The following Doug is the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians, which includes Michael Castello, Deborah DeForge, and Steven Estrada. Michael Castello was hired in March of 2014 to serve as the tribal administrator for the Soboba Band, where his primary responsibilities range from working with the tribal council to achieve goals and objectives of the general counsel, overseeing all tribal employees, consultants, and tribal programs, working cooperative with casino management, staff, to providing oversight of budgets, forecasts, and financial reporting to guide management decisions.</p>
<p>Prior to taking his current position, Mr. Castello most recently served for four and a half years as assistant general manager for the Soboba Casino, two years as chairman of the Soboba Tribal Gaming Commission, and other positions within the tribe's gaming operations. In addition, beginning in March of 1998, Mr. Castello was elected to the Soboba Tribal Council and subsequently appointed to the treasurer position, where he worked with other tribal council members to, among other things, construct the tribe's sports complex and community swimming pool, to supporting the passage of proposition five and proposition 1A, and Soboba's entering into a historical tribal state compact that allowed the tribe to operate up to 2,000 slot machines, and followed the passage of proposition five and 1A, overseeing the expansion of the Soboba Casino from 500 machines to 1,500 machines, leading to a 400 percent increase in casino revenue in just 9 months.</p>
<p>Mr. Castello is a member of the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians, and has four children and three grandchildren, and resides on the tribe's reservation. He's a graduate from Hemet High and received his bachelor's degree in business finance from California State University, San Bernardino.</p>
<p>With Michael is Deb DeForge, and she has worked for Soboba for over two years as a grant writer. Deb works cooperatively with all the departments to find and access additional funding for programs and services. She also serves on the California Indian Education Oversight Committee for the California Department of Education, a position she has held since 2006. The EO Committee provides advice to the California Superintendent of Public Instruction on all matters related to Indian education in California.</p>
<p>As a grant writer and program evaluator, Ms. DeForge has successfully written grants in areas including family literacy, Head Start, Early Head Start, First Five, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Justice, Department of Education, and Department of Indian Education, AmeriCorps, FEMA, and US Department of Energy, to name a few. Ms. DeForge has a BA from the University of Redlands and a master's degree for Azusa Pacific, plus teaching and administrative credentials. She has taught everything from elementary school to resource, special education, middle school, and high school English, and she has written grants, conducted program development and evaluations, conducted staff training for tribes and tribal programs all over the state.</p>

<p>And with that, let's get started with Doug. And Doug, just give me a second to pull up your slide deck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Great.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. And you should be ready to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Great. Thank you very much, Randy, and on behalf of the Office of Indian Energy, thanks to all of our participants, our tribal participants, government participants, and the private sector, for joining us on this webinar today. Once again, my name is Doug McCourt. I'm the senior policy advisor for the Office of Indian Energy here in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>And as we go through my presentation, I'm not going to read my slide. I'm going to hit the high notes. And we do need to move at some speed today because of the number of presenters. But before we dive in, I just want to make a couple of points.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the right business structure can make the difference between success and failure for tribal energy projects or tribal energy business that the tribes wants to pursue, and that covers everything from at the beginning, from the ability to organize all the players needed to carry out the tribe's energy functions, to attracting investment and project finance, and to building an operating – a project or whatever energy business the tribe is intending on pursuing.</p>
<p>So when you think about the concepts that I'm going to discuss today, think not only about what you want to accomplish, if you're the tribe or any other player, but in particular for the tribes, what is it the tribe wants to accomplish and when? Because the choice of the business structure and the time it takes both to set it up and keep it going can affect that very significantly. But what will the tribe's partners need to accomplish, and can they get there through the particular business structure that's chosen?</p>
<p>One last note before we dive in. I believe it was Lizana that mentioned or at least brought up the point about business plans, and the correct business structure really functions optimally inside of a larger development and strategic energy plan. Through the Office of Indian Energy's Technical Assistance, you can learn more about how to accomplish those and get started or actually complete one. And you can go to our Indian Energy website at Energy.gov, and you can find out more about how to get involved in those kind of strategic energy planning efforts. So –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Crosstalk]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           If all the panelists could mute their phones, too, there's a beeping in the background. Sorry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        No problem. So where we are trying to go in the big picture is the historical paradigm in Indian energy is that most of the facilities, certainly utility scale facilities, are not owned by tribal entities. The typical business model was lease-royalty arrangements. There's some exceptions to that, but very few. Tribal employment may have been common, but tribal management in those businesses was less common, and a paradigm of heavy federal control over the development of tribal energy resources. Next slide.</p>
<p>So shifting that is part of this strategic planning and picking the right business for success in building a project, and getting to the next stage, or shifting that paradigm, really means that through the energy – the assessment of a tribe's energy resources, and including that in economic development planning, to learn more about what vehicles are there for tribal investment and for non-tribal investment in the tribe's energy future, with a greater emphasis on tribal management, as well as construction and operation, and the – and capturing the legal movement that we're seeing today with a shrinking control of state, especially in the area of state taxation, over the development of tribes' energy resources.</p>
<p>The point here is the choice of the organizational business model for the project can have a significant impact on the tribe's abilities to shift that paradigm. Next slide.</p>
<p>So another important, entirely separate set of considerations for picking the right business structure is what does this entity really need to accomplish? And these are eight or so bullets of the many functions that a tribal business structure would need to carry out, at least in the area of initiating financing, developing, and operating a project. Next slide.</p>
<p>So the other aspect for picking the right structure is which ones can most easily or at least not prevent the ability of the tribe to capture and/or transfer benefits? And these specifically include the depreciation that's available, the renewable energy credits, of course, the investments or production tax credits, and whether or not certain organizational models, such as Section 17 corporations that bring along certain attributes of the tribe that other forms of business structures, like limited liability companies, may not. Next slide.</p>
<p>So first of all, I think it's important to think about where some of these benefits flow, and how they are structured in terms of where the projects are built. And so when we talk about building energy in Indian Country, we're really talking about Indian land, and we're talking about federally recognized tribes, which include Alaska native village and regional corporations. Next slide.</p>
<p>These two slides have a definition of Indian land, and it's basically – it includes not just the trust land and the reservation, but restricted land and land that is owned by an Indian tribe and was conveyed to the United States under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, or conveyed to the US to a native corporation in exchange for that land. So it's a – it's not just the trust land in the lower 48, but includes a big footprint of land in Alaska as well. Next slide.</p>
<p>So getting back to thinking around what makes the most sense for the choice of a business structure, again, this presentation focusing primarily on energy project development and more of a utility scale development at that, it's understanding the risks that the actual entity will need to engage in. And those include input risk, construction risk, operational risk, output risk, and sales growth and reinvestment risk.</p>
<p>So a key consideration for creating the right business structure is matching the tribe's legal authority and the support they get, financial, political, and legal, to those risks of the venture. Now this can – this doesn't mean all is just building a new asset. It can mean acquiring an asset or acquiring another business as well. Next slide.</p>
<p>Legally, tribes are actually in somewhat more favorable footing than a lot of the non-tribal entities that want to establish businesses, and this goes back to some fundamental United States Supreme Court opinions. First, the tribes are free to choose the form of governmental or nongovernmental organizations through which the tribes do business, and as a general rule, state civil laws won't apply to that business, either because they're preempted by federal law, or those state laws infringe on Indian self-rule. Next slide.</p>
<p>So one of the key considerations is what level of control does the tribe really need to have over this business and in the conduct of the business? The bottom line is that many business transactions do not rise to a level requiring review and approval by the entire council, whether that's an elected or a general council, but in many instances, the non-tribal party may insist on some level of tribal approval, or at least clear lines of authority, and of course, that comes down to certain key contracts, such as leases or any kind of financing.</p>
<p>But in many cases, the transactions may be handled entirely by the relevant tribal enterprise or tribal corporation, not needing to go back to the elected officials. Next slide.</p>
<p>Now one important caveat to that is no matter what structure is set up, at the end of the day, dealing with a tribal business entity, the tribe's law controls. The tribe's constitution and bylaws or treaty and code are the starting point for understanding what the scope of the powers of the tribe are and how they relate to that business. The key issue here is a lot of the constitutions or codes don't spell out the scope of the authority as applied to particular transactions, so they have to look at – when you're examining basically what is the relationship between the authority of the tribe and the authority of the business, is typically on the express limitations on that authority, rather than express grants of authority. Next slide.</p>
<p>There's other sources of law, federal legislation, even defining the reservation boundaries, how the tribe is organized, and to the extent of which state jurisdiction may apply, going into things such as land use and management and federal rights and privileges. So obviously, federal law is something you have to pay attention to here as well. Next slide.</p>
<p>So one important point for the non-tribal entities is that if you get it wrong, if you get this issue wrong of the – of what that authority is, it can be very damaging to any contract that comes out of or is entered into with that business. And that is because the power of a subordinate agency, enterprise, or corporation is a matter of tribal law, and a non-Indian party's claim that it detrimentally relied on the entity's apparent authority isn't good enough. That contract is void ab initio, or what we call _____. And so, again, understanding that tribal law as it affects the operation and the conduct and the scope of authority of that business is absolutely essential to understand from the beginning. Next slide.</p>
<p>So now the tribe needs to think about, well, do we – how close do we want to keep this business to the actual function of the tribal government? And the starting point is it can either be a part of the tribe or a legal entity entirely separate from the tribe. The further distance you go, the more linkages you break between the integral part of the privileges and immunities that the tribe reserves for itself under its own status, and we'll give you some examples of that as we go through the presentation. Next slide.</p>
<p>So let's start with just doing the deal with the tribe. Many successful ventures, and some of the largest commercial or utility scale projects, renewable energy projects on tribal land, or fossil fuel projects, were done directly with the tribes themselves. So there is a model of successful ventures being undertaken directly with the tribe, and of course, on the tribe side, the benefits include the ability to assert sovereign immunity, exemption from federal income tax, the ability to issue tax exempt financing, and direct authority over that business.</p>
<p>The downside includes potentially exposing tribal assets to liability, delays in approval due to political processes, and a shifting at least level of experience with business ventures. Next slide.</p>
<p>So the next step is, okay, if we don't – if we want to take the energy business outside of the tribe itself, and the tribal elected body, the tribal enterprise, or the tribal instrumentality, as it's called in certain cases, is – and those two terms are interchangeable – is also a common vehicle. Those entities are still part of the tribe. Typically, they're formed by tribal resolution, ordinance, or code, but they're always or at least most typically managed by a separate board of directors or staff separate from the actual tribal government.</p>
<p>With those enterprises, certain financing options may not be available without full tribal approval, but typically, the authority includes the ability to incur debt, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued without exposing the tribe and its fiscal resources to liability. Next slide.</p>
<p>Now there is a creature of business structure called a political subdivision, or tribal political subdivision, and these are essentially a full delegation of sovereign powers to a separate governmental entity set up by the tribe, typically requiring BIA and often IRS confirmation. In establishing those, of course, they carry the attributes of the tribe with it, which includes the exemption from income tax and the sovereign immunity issues I raised earlier.</p>
<p>But they may be less flexible than a tribal corporate entity, and perhaps most important, less attractive to some outside business investors and partners, because it's simply a model they're not used to dealing with, and they do have some tax consequences, by bringing those non-taxable entities into business with parties that are exposed to tax. Next slide.</p>
<p>I think we can move on from this. It's just another slide that goes into the political subdivision.</p>
<p>So what we're seeing as a growing form of successful tribal business structure for energy projects is what's known as the Section 17 corporation. Section 17 is simply a reference to 25 USC Section 477 under the Indian Reorganization Act. It's been around for decades. To establish a Section 17 corporation, it requires first a tribal resolution, then through a simple letter to the BIA, BIA approves – well, the tribal resolution approves a proposed charter. That goes off to BIA. They review it, typically comment on it and edit it. And then once that negotiation is complete, it comes back. The tribe then has to ratify the BIA approved charter, and the corporation is up and running.</p>
<p>Now for Section 17 corporations, they have to be wholly owned by the tribe, which precludes equity ownership by outside investors, although subsidiary entities can be set up under the Section 17, which can bring in outside investment. Next slide.</p>
<p>So what are the benefits of setting this Section 17 up? Well, the assets of the Section 17 corp may be pledged as collateral, and that includes a lease. Again, they pass through the tribe's exemption from federal income tax. They can issue tax exempt debt. Unlike political subdivisions, the assets and liabilities are wholly separate from the assets and liabilities of the tribe, and that protects both sides there. They can sue or be sued in their corporate form with the tribe retaining sovereign immunity. This is an important point. What this means is the corporation is able to waive sovereign immunity on behalf of itself, but it doesn't waive the tribe's sovereign immunity.</p>
<p>And there is 25 year leasing authority that waives the requirement for Section 81 approval of leases and contracts by BIA. So that is another huge benefit of the Section 17 corporation. At least if you can do your deal in that 25 year leasing horizon, then you can – and oftentimes, if that isn't enough time for the particular project or entity, you can shift it to a different corporate form, if it needs to run longer. Next slide.</p>
<p>So there are a number of tribes that have their own laws that charter corporation. They, again, typically separate corporate assets and liabilities from tribal assets and liabilities. Typically, the laws have fairly broad financing options. But the IRS has not treated these entities the same in each case. So their tax status is uncertain, and they may or may not be able to issue tax exempt debt. Next slide.</p>
<p>State charter corporations, typically not chosen by tribes for a variety of reasons, are probably the easiest to form. However – and they accomplish a full separation of assets and liabilities from the tribe, but they don't bring any of the attributes of the tribe to the corporation. So for example, the state charter corporation cannot assert sovereign immunity. They're subject to state laws and state reporting requirements, and of course, subject to federal income tax. But typically, they should have the same financing tools in general available to them as tribal corporations. Next slide.</p>
<p>Similarly, state chartered limited liability companies, very easy to form for a low cost to form, and they actually may be needed to bring in certain federal or state tax benefits that are only eligible through this particular form. Similar to a state corporation, there's a full separation of assets and liabilities from the tribe, but none of those attributes are carried forward. You get the tax benefits a state LLC, which we'll discuss in a minute, but they can't issue tax exempt debt. Next slide.</p>
<p>So when we look at, well, what's actually going on out there? What are the most common types of entities for creating a joint venture between the non-tribal business partner and a tribe, you know, it's usually a corporation limited liability company or a partnership. The Section 17 corporation could establish any one of those or all of those entities as an umbrella organization set up by the tribe, and that's why they're such a powerful vehicle. Next slide.</p>
<p>So just a few notes about the difference between a corporation, an LLC, and a partnership here. Of course, the reason corporations are set up is they separate personal liability from the asset – activities of the corporation. Now unless that entity is a wholly owned Section 17 or a wholly owned tribal corporation, it is going to be subject to federal income tax, and even then, the tax treatment is not always certain, where taxable and non-taxable partners participate, and of course, by bringing in the tribe's partnership, you are bringing in – you're mixing the non-taxable and the taxable. Next slide.</p>
<p>Partnership has some benefits in the sense that both limited and general partnerships enjoy the same tax status. It's not – the partnership's not directly subject to federal income tax. Each partner reports their share of income and losses. And the IRS has issued clear guidance that tribal partners are not subject to federal income tax in a general or limited partnership. Next slide.</p>
<p>So when it comes down to it, the easiest thing to do, the cheapest entity to form, and the most flexible form, is the limited liability company, and that's because it is – it combines the limited personal liability of the corporate formation status with the pass-through tax feature of partnerships. The LLC doesn't have the attributes of the tribe, again, important to remember, and cannot issue tax exempt debt. And tribal participation in certain LLCs may make certain types of federal tracts, credits, and depreciation benefits difficult or prohibited, although there – we're trying to get around that in certain respects through some of the federal structures that have been created as – under the HEARTH Act. Next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Five minutes, Doug.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Thank you. So I wanted to give you an example – you know, that's a lot of detail around what the – what the pros and cons of typical structure are. I wanted to just show you an example of a project that was acquired by a Section 17 corporation, and now is being successfully operated, and this is the – what was formerly known as the Kerr Dam, acquired last year by the Salish-Kootenai Tribe in Montana, of the Flathead Reservation. Next slide.</p>
<p>A little bit of detail, 188 megawatt project, fairly good, consistent annual output from that facility, serves a lot of household hours per year, and provides a significant amount of flood control. Next slide.</p>
<p>So Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes acquired this because they – FERC originally issued the license for this facility on the tribe's land, and it had a provision that allowed the tribe when relicensing came up 50 years later, they could intervene and seek a ownership position in the project. They decided to do that, and the time that passed between their intervention and the time to actually exercise that option required the tribe to get its act together, figure out how and whether it could form a successful business venture around acquiring this asset, and so what it did is it developed Energy Keepers, Inc., a Section 17 business enterprise, to exercise that option, which then led to the possession, management, and operation of the former Kerr Dam. Next slide.</p>
<p>So then this had occurred. The Energy Keepers assumed last Labor Day possession and operation of Kerr, and they are selling the electrical output as a wholesale power generator to provide a long term stream of income to the Confederated Tribes as the sole shareholder. And subsequently, the tribe established a Tribal Department of Energy to oversee successful completion of the goals. And again, this goes back to one of the first points that we made, is they didn't just take this on as an isolated business venture. They wrapped it into part of a vision and a actual energy plan and strategy in the Department of Energy for the tribe, and subsequently sought some assistance from the Department of Energy to accomplish those goals. Next slide.</p>
<p>So I'm going to essentially wrap up here. If any of the listeners were on our last month's webinar, you know I talked a little bit about the update of the energy bills in Congress, and one of the options that are available to tribes that has not been taken advantage of so far, the Tribal Energy Resource Agreement, is now proposed to be reformed and revised through what was Senate 2132, later wrapped into Senate 209 in the last session, and now is part of Senate 2012, the Senate's comprehensive energy bill. Next slide.</p>
<p>The purpose of it, and Senator Barrasso is the champion and the cosponsor of this bill, is that in 2005, everybody thought we were putting this great vehicle on the street to allow tribes an alternate mechanism of avoiding the BIA leasing process, to enter into a compact, essentially, with the Department of Interior, and take over the tribal development. Well, it didn't work, because it put a lot of burden of running those process, establishing those processes, and maintaining them at the tribal level, and frankly, the contracts were complicated, so nobody did it. Next slide.</p>
<p>So Senator Barrasso's bill, again, that's been wrapped into the Senate 2012 now, it would amend the existing authority, have an automatic approval if the Secretary of Interior doesn't disapprove the TARA application within 270 days, and it has some easier qualification for demonstrating some of the key criteria, including the capacity to regulate energy resources pursuant to a TARA. That's one of the key requirements. Next slide.</p>
<p>Other changes that are being proposed include limiting challenges to environmental review under TARAs to interested parties, and directing the Secretary of Interior to make available to TARA tribes their shares of federal funding. It clarifies limitations on the potential liability of the US under an agreement entered into by – into a TARA.</p>
<p>And a note I'll just make there is that this created a lot of consternation for tribes at the time the TARA proposal was made back in 2005, but remember this. The US Supreme Court has made it clear that in a – the tribes cannot basically initiate or carry through a trust lawsuit against the United States unless Congress has specifically authorized a remedy under a federal statute for that trust lawsuit. And you don't have those in Section 17. You don't have them in any other of the forms of business authority that I discussed earlier here today. You don't have them under the Hearth Act. So essentially, any tribe that's concerned about going down the TARA road because it has a waiver of liability, you're not in any better setting by choosing a different form, if your concern is a trust lawsuit against the United States for failure to live up to any part of these agreements. Next slide.</p>
<p>Other features of the TARA amendments. There's some technical assistance, demonstration programs, and interestingly, a clarification that tribes are now included in the municipal preference under the Federal Power Act for applying for hydro-permitting, and this can include pump storage projects, off river projects, as well as your typical hydro projects. So a big move there. Next slide.</p>
<p>And I just have a little more information in the slide deck about what that Senate bill does. Next slide.</p>
<p>So where I'm going to end here is on hopefully a positive note, and that is that if we look back certainly from 2005, but just in the last ten years, there have been a number of administrative changes, like the wind and solar lease amendments that have required Congress to act. We've seen an increase and an improvement, although slight, in federal agency program budgets, to promote tribal energy development. There's a lot more needed, but it's been a positive development.</p>
<p>Then the political landscape is fertile because many of the underlying themes, jobs, self-determination, economic growth, have found bipartisan support, and that's why you have movement now in Congress on bipartisan energy bills: ultimately, pressure to share results instead of gridlock.</p>
<p>So with that, I will end there. I'll look forward to digging into further details with the rest of our presenters. Thank you, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you, Doug. Excellent. And Michael, just give me a moment to get your slide deck pulled up. Okay, Michael, let's see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Castello:       _____ going to start the presentation, and then we're going to contribute as we progress through the presentation, if that's okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Background voices]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           I've got to re-pull up your deck here. All right. We're good. It's all yours, Michael.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Castello:       All right. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. Sorry. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to turn it over to our environmental protection manager, Steven Estrada, to start the presentation, and then myself and Deborah are going to contribute as needed throughout the presentation. So what I'd like to do is turn it over to Mr. Estrada to begin the presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Steven Estrada:          All right. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and I just want to thank the Department of Energy on behalf of the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians for providing the opportunity for us to present to you this morning. So we'll go ahead and get started going onto the next slide. Just a brief history of the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians established by executive order in 1883. There is about eight other federally recognized bands of Luiseno Indians, and they refer to themselves as Payómkawichum, or People of the West. The reservation is located approximately an hour and a half out of East LA, kind of in between Palm Springs and Los Angeles. Next slide.</p>
<p>Currently, the tribe consists of approximately 1,300 members. That's both Cahuilla and Luiseno ancestry here. This is approximately 7,800 acres of land in trust, and that includes newly formed trust lands as of last summer, June 2015. The tribe added approximately 500 acres to trust status for economic development reasons. Next slide.</p>
<p>Here on the reservation, there are multiple entities and departments. There's tribal administration, which includes a tribal government, accounting services, social services, public safety, cultural and environmental. There's also a parks and recreation department that includes a gym complex, softball fields, baseball fields, and a football field. There is also public works, the casino, a country club, a Noli Indian School on the reservation, as well as a Soboba Preschool, which includes kindergarten and preschool. Next slide.</p>
<p>So as the tribal leadership progressed and had all these projects coming about, they were really looking to diversify economic development opportunities on the reservation. It kind of started with resource planning, environmental assessments, and looking into economic and real estate development, including agricultural opportunities, real estate, or commercial businesses, besides just the casino. Next slide.</p>
<p>And that led into a partnership with Optimum Group, and they were hired on to do a master land use plan and to kind of identify land use plans of the reservation. That included looking at land use planning and development, hydrology and flood control, wastewater treatment options for the reservation, and solar energy. Next slide.</p>
<p>Specifically for solar energy, a feasibility study was conducted by the Optimum Group. It included predevelopment and development stages. Kind of looking over it, it was determined that there was an average – a 2 year average use of 15 megawatt hours for planning area B, I believe, that was identified, which included all of the entities that were discussed earlier.</p>
<p>So out of that feasibility study, it was concluded that a 1 megawatt facility would serve for planning areas A, B, and D, and there was about 14 separate meters for all these areas. Next slide.</p>
<p>So under the feasibility study for solar, there were site evaluations, geographical research analysis, kind of preliminary research for available sola programs that were identified for the tribe. And then a strategy was proposed to the tribal council. Next slide.</p>
<p>As the tribe kind of honed in on a specific area to start the solar project, various studies were done by both the tribe and Optimum Group. A site was identified. Approximately five acres was set aside for a one megawatt facility. Environmental assessment was done. An environmental constraints report, geotechnical studies, and other surveys were conducted prior to developing the site. And along the same lines, while this was proceeding, the grants coordinator, Deb DeForge, was able to secure a DOE grant in the amount of $1 million to help put towards the project.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, the tribe allocated $5 million to assist with the development of multiple environmental – I'm sorry, multiple solar projects on the reservation. Next slide.</p>
<p>As we progressed, the tribe was looking at different case studies on how other tribes developed solar projects throughout the United States. Legal counsel was hired specifically for this project, because the tribe was actually looking at going and trying to incentivize tax credits through a partnership. It was a very long process, and what came out of it was it was very difficult to get an outside investor to try to incentivize the tax credits because of the grant. The DOE still had a vested interest in the equipment, so a partnership wouldn't necessarily work out because of that interest from the DOE.</p>
<p>So after that very lengthy review process that was conducted – it was concluded that the investment tax credits would not work out for the tribe. But nonetheless, the tribe still decided to move forward with the project, and the return on investment and the benefits projected – sorry – the return on investment for the project was projected to save approximately $6 million over the lifetime of the system, which is a huge economic benefit to the tribe, expected to generate a rate of 14 percent on return, and not just for the economic development of the project, but there's also job opportunities and training opportunities for the tribal members here on the reservation. Next slide.</p>
<p>It's a little difficult to see, but this is a map of a portion of the reservation. There is a small rectangle shape – that's the solar field, towards the bottom, and then all these different meters are for the sports complex, tribal government buildings, public works. So these were all going to be tied into this initial solar project. Next slide.</p>
<p>The tribe looked at multiple programs that were available as far as net metering, V-net metering, or a PPA with Edison, but it was determined that the V-net metering would be best suited for this project, because of the multiple meters located on the reservation. Next slide.</p>
<p>So like I said, the tribe saw a _____ opportunity for this one megawatt facility, and went with the virtual net metering for these planning areas located on the map. Next slide.</p>
<p>So this brought us to the RFP process, and submitting it out for bid. We were very successful with the help of Optimum Group with the RFP process. Following procurement policies, we received a total of six proposals that ranged from $2 to $3 million. Next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        In taking the EPC, we had to look at warranties, payment schedules, and then the biggest part of the process for us has been the interconnection agreement with Southern California Edison, because they have to go through a whole process of connecting to our easements, all the language, the contract language, the cost, the renewable energy credits that we'll get, and then what kind of connection fees and contacts and agreements have to go with that.</p>
<p>It also takes into account Rule 21, and that's a law in California that concerns the technical requirements for interconnecting fuller to the grid. Next slide. Next slide. Sorry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Steven Estrada:          So as far as the grant and financing process, it was very lengthy, submitting all the necessary requirements for grant negotiations to the Department of Energy. That included budget justification and other items that they needed. Also, the environmental clearance, and we'll discuss that more on the next slide.</p>
<p>So as far as the experiences learned, under this grant, it wasn't required that – an environmental assessment to be conducted. However, the tribe did choose to go ahead with that, and we found that it made the whole process easier when it came to NEPA compliance. We were able to provide the environmental assessment to the NEPA compliance officer, which made it – made it easier and saved a lot of time in getting the environmental clearance for this project.</p>
<p>Another lengthy process, like Deb said, was interconnection agreements with Southern California Edison, very complex, very time consuming, and very costly. But the tribe was able to allocate funding out of that $5 million to this. And also, another thing to remember is that as you proceed with the RFP process, you really need to customize the system to the tribe's needs, and not let the contactor kind of call the shots, especially for security systems. A lot of contractors just want to throw up one or two cameras, but really, talk to the various departments that you work with, your IT departments, public safety, just to see what the needs are specifically that will work for your solar site. Next slide.</p>
<p>Here is kind of some photos of the site development, initial grading, then the delivery of equipment, and the last picture on the right was approximately two weeks ago. It was almost fully up and running. Next slide.</p>
<p>And that is all we have. Thank you, again, so much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you, Mike, Deborah, and Steven, and Jon, just give me a moment to get your slide deck pulled up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           There we go. It's all yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                Great. So I'd like to thank everyone for being on today. It's a great opportunity for rural development, part of USDA, rural development, to present to you today. What I'd like to do is give you kind of an overview of the rural development programs with some more details of specifically the Rural Utilities Service and the Electric Program. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>So USDA, we have a Secretary, Tom Vilsack, and we're made up of different missionaries. The missionary that we belong to is obviously rural development. USDA is a huge organization. But we're the one missionary that is dedicated to rural economic development in rural communities, education, health care for rural communities, broadband, clean drinking water, affordable electricity, all for rural America, as well as we have housing programs and business programs. Next slide.</p>
<p>So our mission is pretty simple, to assist rural communities in creating prosperity and to help them be self-sustaining, economically prosperous, and we do that through a combination of funding of loans and grants to communities, to entities, to cooperatives. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>So the rural development program areas, and I just wanted to share this slide with you all, so that you could see, even though we're focusing on the Rural Utilities Service electric programs, rural development really is an agency that can literally build a community or a town from the ground up. Through the Rural Utilities Service, we offer programs that have financing for electric, broadband, and telecommunications services, as well as water and environmental programs, water and wastewater disposable systems. We also have rural housing and community facilities programs for rural America, home ownership loans, self-help assistance loans, multi-family housing and single family housing loans and grants. We also have community facilities loans and grants, essential community facilities, even things like firetrucks and ambulances, certainly schools, hospitals, those sorts of things, bricks and mortar, we can fund in those programs.</p>
<p>And our rural business and cooperative service programs are really aimed at business incubator for rural America, rural business development grants, intermediary lending, our B&amp;I guaranteed loans, value added producer grants. So I wanted to give you a flavor for those, and as you'll see in just a little bit, the Rural Utilities Service is more of a centrally operated, meaning out of headquarters, Washington, DC, with a field staff dedicated to it.</p>
<p>The other two programs are primarily operated from the state offices, so a direct point of contact would be whatever state you're in, there's a rural development state director, and of course, that information is listed on our website. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>So we are at the national office here for the Rural Utilities Service, and our primary link to our borrowers is through this box over here, the general field representatives. There's about 25 to 30 general field representatives that are strategically located across the US who work for the Electric Program, work directly with borrowers, potential borrowers, grantees, potential grantees, and then assembling actually the applications for financing. They're there to help. They're there to work with you. It's not a do it on your own, send it to Washington and see if you get it right. These folks are on the ground to provide all sorts of assistance, both technical, financial, and walk you through the application process.</p>
<p>And our state directors at the state office level, of course, they have state directors and they have area directors of expertise of the different programs that I was just talking about, incredibly valuable resources there at the state level as well. Next slide.</p>
<p>The rural development funding stream is basically right there. There are four streams: guaranteed loans, direct loans, direct payments, and grants. What I'm going to be taking about is in the area of guaranteed loans and grants. I should differentiate. A lot of times when you think about federal guaranteed loans, it's the federal government guaranteeing a private bank for the lending. In this instance, these guaranteed loans, the government's actually guaranteeing itself. These loans are made from the Federal Financing Bank, which is part of Treasury, so they're treasury rate financing. It's just that the agency is guaranteeing the Treasury that the loan will be repaid, and the agency would actually have to pay the loan if it didn't get repaid back to Treasury. But for all practical purposes, as a recipient of one of these guaranteed loans, you're receiving a government – a loan directly from the government. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>So rural utilities programs stem out of the Depression era, the history of the Rural Electrification Administration. It was formed in the late 1930s to bring power to the land. Next slide.</p>
<p>Real quick, obviously, back then, life was very labor intensive, without the modern tools that were becoming available in urban and suburban areas. Next slide. And even health care and – there were major health care issues. Financial concerns were a major issue. Next slide.</p>
<p>So in essence, from the utilities' standpoint, private utilities were unwilling to serve the rural areas. There wasn't enough incentive for them to be there. There wasn't really a return on investment that was available to them. And the cost of service that they did serve out there, in order to recoup the high cost of providing service, was just too high. Next slide.</p>
<p>So now we come into the Rural Utilities Service of modern today. The electric program started in 1935. Our telecommunications and broadband program started in 1949. Our water and environmental programs started back in 1937. And these – as I went through those slides, which is just a little bit of history, even today, across the country, and particularly in some tribal areas, we have some of those same challenges, and we're working very hard to partner with our tribal leaders to make a difference and make sure that we can improve the infrastructure needs there. Next slide.</p>
<p>This is just a visual depiction of the number of projects and where they're located across the US. We've got infrastructure projects in over 80 percent of the land mass affecting 25 percent of the entire population. So we're pretty much everywhere in terms of one of the three programs, if not all three, in these rural areas. Next slide.</p>
<p>So the principles in the electric program, and what we want to do is be able to provide the affordable financing that's needed to build infrastructure. We have low interest rate funding. Our interest rates are tied to the Treasury rate of borrowing. For instance, then, if you're getting a 20 year loan, you would get essentially the 20 year Treasury rate. It is the cheapest available interest rate anywhere. And we can even actually – I'll have a slide that can show you how we can bring that down further, but we have tools available to us to even go lower than the 20 or 35 year rates, because we can take advantage of short term rates and roll over debt, which might in the short run really enhance a project's feasibility, because it allows somebody to take currently as short as a 90 day rate, roll it over every 90 days. That rate's under one percent, and you can imagine how much interest savings that could add up to.</p>
<p>Our loans are amortized over a period of up to 35 years. It has obvious benefits for helping long term construction projects and repayment of those projects. It certainly helps with cash flow, being able to provide financing that long. The private sector does not come close in terms of a trajectory for that type of financing. But it's been a longstanding principle in rural America that we know that it takes a lot of investment, it's very costly to build in rural America, and we need to make these loans and their terms and conditions affordable for the rate payers.</p>
<p>We have a provision of area coverage, which means that when we make a loan, everyone in the certificated service area gets treated the same, and that's essentially the co-op model anyway. That's part of the longstanding principles of the co-ops, is that everyone within the service territory gets the same high quality, affordable service. Co-ops obviously operate under the principle that they're owned by those they serve. The agency more so in the past has standardized rural engineering. We still do have a lot of our standardized engineering bulletins that are out there that are used not only nationwide but worldwide in some instances. This was a real key to building the ubiquitous interconnected electric grid across the country to have standardized engineering principles, practices.</p>
<p>And then, of course, we also have environmental assessment and review requirements. All of our environmental reviews are handled in house here with our water and environmental staff, but it's important to note that before we get started on any financing, that we address all of the EPA requirements for environmental assessment and reviews. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>So when a loan comes to Washington, it's put together by our GFRs out in the field, our general field representatives, and I'll show you where they're located in just a minute. But the loan package is assembled. It comes to Washington. We've got a financial operations branch which basically is going to run the numbers and make sure the loan is feasible and can be repaid. We've got an engineering branch here that helps borrowers make sure that they've designed their system properly, and that it's going to perform the way that they constructed it to perform. And of course, then our general field representatives, again, are our eyes and ears in the field, and our primary contact with our borrowers. Next slide.</p>
<p>This is a visual representation of where the – our general field representatives are essentially located. It's a little bit difficult to see, but as you can see, we've got them strategically placed across the country in three different branches. They all report to a supervisory GFR in the field, if you will, and those people then report back to the Washington headquarters staff. Next slide.</p>
<p>So our program right now as it stands, the RUS Electric Cooperatives and the cooperatives nationwide, they provide retail electric power to 42 million people, customers. They serve over 13 percent of the nation's meters. And interestingly, they own 42 percent of the total distribution lines. That statistic always sticks out to me, anyway, because it really shows you how much of the grid is rural and how much is being operated by the electric co-ops in the rural space. And we have some – we have several tribal utility authorities that are also borrowers of ours who are operating as part of the grid itself.</p>
<p>They generate about 5 percent of electricity produced, deliver about 11 percent of the total kilowatts used throughout _____. Their sales are 57 percent residential and 43 percent commercial and industrial. And that's to be expected, that the residential is higher in rural America, but as you can see, the 43 percent is not bad, either. Obviously, you need reliable power to produce economic development and job creation, and there's a nice little tidbit there that according to the National Academy of Engineering, electrification had the number one engineering impact on the 21st – on the 20th century. So we'll see what happens in the 21st century. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>Also within the electric program we focus on renewable energy. We do have a fairly large footprint as far as coal power plants go, but we also actively finance renewable energy, including wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, hydro. This is very important. As we – as our cooperatives seek to add more renewable energy to their product lines and also as they look for ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan and EPA's upcoming environmental requirements, renewable energy is playing an ever-increasing role in our portfolio. We've increased our renewable energy just tenfold in the last year alone.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency and conservation programs are also very important. These are part of our regular programs. But what this allows us to do is to have pass-through loans to our cooperatives as borrowers. They in turn can lend the money, on-bill financing to their consumers, residents, or businesses for things like weatherization, energy efficiency, smart appliances, geothermal, things of that nature. So this is like a pass-through program that provides the co-op with financing to turn around and utilize – to improve energy efficiency and conservation, something that is extremely important. Even as loads remain relatively steady, demand remains relatively steady, the plants tend to wear down, obviously, and need to be replaced and upgraded. But energy efficiency and reducing demand can certainly forestall having to add additional capacity.</p>
<p>And then we have a small grant program, our Assistance in High Energy – our High Energy Cost Grant Program, which is essentially a program that – I say it's small. It's only around $10 million, and it's a national competition. But this program is designed for the benefit of rural communities to bring down energy costs where they exceed the national average by over 275 percent. So that's pretty high energy costs.</p>
<p>Typically, the areas that we see successful in this competition are in Alaska, Hawaii, some in the Southwest, certainly the Pacific Islands, maybe up in Maine area, and some of the islands off the coast of Maine, a lot of generator-type electricity. It's very expensive there. So this program helps to lower those overall community costs. It's not an individual-based program where an individual just applies say to put solar panels on their home. It's a community-based program, which is supposed to benefit the entire community. Next slide.</p>
<p>A few years ago, under the Farm Bill, Congress enacted what is known as the SUTA provision, which is the Substantially Underserved Trust Areas. So for any of the programs that I've talked about, our lending programs, the provisions and the authorities of SUTA apply. SUTA is defined as a community in trust land with respect to which the Secretary determines has a high need for benefits of an eligible program. For the electric program, it applies to the electric program. It also applies to our broadband program.</p>
<p>So what it does is it gives us the authority to make loans and loan guarantees with interest rates as low as two percent. Say the prevailing rate was five or six percent for a 35 year loan. SUTA allows us to drop that rate to a fixed rate of two percent for the entire duration of the loan.</p>
<p>We can waive non-duplication restrictions or any equity or credit support requirements. It allows us to give an application that invokes SUTA privileges. The highest priority, take it to the top of the queue, process it with priority in mind. Of course, the loans must be feasible, still, but SUTA is something that we want to make sure that our potential borrowers are aware of when they're serving or applying for loans from native lands or trust lands. Next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Five minutes, Jon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                Okay. So we've been doing this for 80 years. This is the 80th anniversary of the Rural Electrification Act, and we've got an outstanding portfolio of $43 billion. We're providing electric service to over 90 percent of the nation's persistent poverty counties, that include out migration or having other economic hardships.</p>
<p>So our mission isn't over. Things playing a large role coming down the pike, in addition to things of – such as renewable energy and distributed generation, and I apologize for not having a slide about it, but smart grid. Smart grid is an incredibly important component of the grid today, and being able to prewire the grid with fiber so that we can meet the communications needs of our distribution borrowers and our generation transmission borrowers so that they're no longer in the business of sending electrons one way, they're managing power flow, they're getting power sold back to them off the grid from renewable sources. There's distributed generation.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about smart grid is if you got the fiber going all the way to the meter to read the meter and make sure that you can position yourself for the smart home of the future, you've also got a broadband connection that can be tapped in as well. So it's kind of a two-for, if you will, in terms of that.</p>
<p>Now from a financing standpoint, we're in a smart grid swim lane. We will finance the fiber to the meter for smart grid. Notwithstanding, though, the ancillary use for broadband is something that could be done as well once those facilities are in place. Next slide.</p>
<p>So it takes a partnership, as you all know as well as I do, of community leaders, the residents, sometimes the local banks, and really visionaries. And so we are here to help in any way. I know this has been a relatively short presentation. I hope you visit our website. I hope you contact me for any specifics or if you want to set aside more time to talk about our programs. And with that, I'll conclude my presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you, Jon, and Bob, just give me a moment to get your slide deck pulled up. Okay, Bob. You're good to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bob Parkins:               Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah, out of respect for everyone's time, I'm going to breeze through my presentation and just highlight some of the key thoughts.</p>
<p>First of all, I'd like to say that going back to the discussions of Soboba Project, this morning, we had the substantially complete walk-through for phase one, which is a one megawatt solar ground mount PD project, and also today we're going to have the pre-bid conference for phase two, which is another one megawatt solar PD project. So by the end of the summer, Soboba will have two megawatts of solar systems in operation.</p>
<p>My involvement with the Optimum Group was in the evaluation of the solar system and running the RFP process, and what I'd like to explore today – by the way, change the slide, Randy, please – is to just explore some generic fundamental principles of effective requests for proposals, and concentrating specifically for Soboba. First of all, I just want to point out that an RFP is not just another procurement method, something that you may be required to do. It's actually the opportunity to choose the best combination of quality and economic value. In other words, get the best quality product for the best possible price. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>So out of 40 years of professional engineering experience, and working with RFPs, I've come to a conclusion as to some things that make them work better, and these are, among other things, sticking to a tightly defined scope and resisting the – deviating from that scope. You will find that salesmen will try to get you to buy their product or service or even to buy up, and this makes the proposal evaluation exceptionally difficult. So instead of just ranking proposals by apples versus apples, you may end up with apples versus broccoli, which can be very difficult.</p>
<p>We find in my years of experience that if a client hires a qualified and experienced solar specialist who can survey their needs and the options that are available and then define a solution that is best for their specific circumstance, that you often achieve the best result. The solution that that specialist comes up with was the basis for our RFP, and that is what I would suggest for any potential client here.</p>
<p>Grants are available, by the way, to fund the specialist's fee. And that leads into the second or the last point on this slide. Oh, if you go back, and that is – I'm going to get in trouble with many of my fellow consultants, but I would highly suggest that you avoid consultants who charge a percentage of the construction cost for their fee. I have seen fees as high as ten percent of the entire construction cost.</p>
<p>And that produces two issues. Number one, it's their divided loyalties. Who do they work for? There's too much of a motivation to keep the proposal high, to keep their fee higher as well. And this means that oftentimes the total fees are much more expensive than if you just hire a consultant directly. So the big key is you want them to work for you, not for themselves. Next slide.</p>
<p>I find that the most effective RFPs are ones that avoid the lowest cost bid. The lowest bids are prone to use cheaper equipment, which translates into usually lesser quality, and also lower bids end up in cutting corners and sacrificing lower life cycle costs, better known as the cost of ownership, for the benefit of a cheaper first cost.</p>
<p>So in summary, the idea is to seek the best quality at a reasonable cost. Also, strive for a simple RFP. Solar systems are not complex. There are too many RFPs out there with very complex and burdensome and costly requirements. This is important, because when you do have a burdensome RFP, it causes the proposers to spend a lot of time to prepare. They have to acquire specialized skills, and it costs a lot of money.</p>
<p>In previous projects where I was helping clients develop a proposal in response to an RFP, that particular client spent over $30,000.00 just to submit a proposal, and so obviously, this is an unnecessary barrier that does restrict competition.</p>
<p>So basically, what I'm trying to convey is try to keep the RFP simple, describe exactly what you want, just like if you went and ordered a car from your local dealership. You tell them what model you want, what size engine, what color, and what other options.</p>
<p>I also have listed here some other things which you should include in your proposal to help the proposer develop their final cost. Next slide, please.</p>
<p>Now in Soboba, we basically had two approaches. We were interested in the proposals describing their project and their team attributes, the quality that they can present and bring to the table, as well as the project cost. Now as for quality, we specifically requested that the proposers indicate their experience completing projects of the same scope. So in our case, we wanted a one megawatt ground-mounted fixed-tilt PD system, so basically, we asked the proposers to demonstrate their recent experience doing exactly that type of a project. We also were very interested in the proposed team that the proposer was bringing to the project and their experience.</p>
<p>Ideally, we were looking for a team that had completed the previous referenced project. So therefore, we would get proven experience. We requested, finally, also a complete set of permitted construction drawings for the project of the same scope. The idea here is to basically – if a proposer claims to have completed a similar project, we want to just see their design drawings as confirmation. The quality and comprehensiveness of the construction drawing set tells a lot about a company's knowledge and competency.</p>
<p>And very importantly, we are interested in references. References can tell us the quality of the project that was completed, how long it took to build it, was the contractor easy to work with? In other words, did he concentrate on customer care? Were there any problems? And did the contractor correct those problems? Next slide, please.</p>
<p>Relative to the cost aspect of the request for information, we just ask for a list of different statistical items, site plans, electric schematics, equipment list, so we could verify the quality of the equipment. And then the same thing applies for the system cost. Next slide.</p>
<p>Now as for the selection process, what we did is first of all, we reviewed every proposal to see if they were complete and responsive to all the RFP requirements. Then after that, we started a process of ranking every proposal, and we basically were looking for several issues, like was the proposed design suitable? Was the proposer and his team highly qualified? Were they using high quality equipment? Did they have good references? And based upon that information, as well as their costs, we would rank them. Then we went back, starting from the lowest cost project, going progressively up, we would choose those that we thought represented the best quality combination of quality and cost.</p>
<p>We then took the three best, and – with a recommendation, and submitted that to the tribal council for their final selection decision. So in summary, that's what we did for the RFP. I know I went through it very quickly, but I'd be willing to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you very much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you, Bob, and thanks, all our speakers, Lizana, Doug, Michael, Deb, Steven, Jon. And let's go to Q&amp;A now and see what questions we have. It just will take me a moment to – I want to close this out so we can open up our Q&amp;A slide. Just bear with me here. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to leave that slide up for a moment. Let's see what written questions have been submitted. Just bear with me. And just a reminder to the audience, if you want to ask a question directly to our panel, raise your hand, click the raise your hand icon, and let's see what written questions we have. Just give me a moment here.</p>
<p>Okay. There are no written questions yet, so just bear with me. Still going through the list. Okay. What structures worked for using DOE tribal energy grants along with the ITC PTC?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Well, this is Doug from Indian Energy, and if I'm understanding the question, I think what it's trying to get at is are there structures that don't work? But maybe if I'm not interpreting that correctly, I – there's no particular structure – basically, our funding is eligible to federally recognized tribes that's defined to include Alaska native village and regional corporations, tribal energy resource development organizations established by those tribes, but our statutes don't define the particular format in which those tribal energy resource development agreements can be established, and they don't restrict you to a particular form. And I think that's very important to understand.</p>
<p>So to the extent – if that's what the question is getting at – and the second part of the question really was is there a – in blending the ITC and the PTC, it's more an issue of will a particular structure that can allow a party who is subject to – that is eligible to bring in a tax credit or receive a tax credit, allow that party to participate, there's no real linkage between our grant programs and the ITC and the PTC. But what you do encounter is that certain structures can prohibit the participation by either certain taxable or non-taxable parties, and that can have an effect on the ability of the – of the business entity to bring in the ITC or the PTC. So you have to look at that very carefully. And I'd refer you back to the slide desk in my presentation to look at those various forms for that particular issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Great. Thanks, Doug. Another question for you. Can you provide a link to more info on the biomass provision of the new Senate Energy Bill regarding demonstration projects?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        I certainly can. What I have to do, since – what happened in Senate 2012 is the elements of S209 were incorporated by voice vote. I don't have that link at my fingertips, but I can certainly add that to the presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Great. And just a reminder to everyone, a follow-up email will come to those who attended today, as well as those who did not attend, with the link to the webinar recording and the slide deck, which will be available in about one week.</p>
<p>Still looking for more questions. Just bear with me. All right. Bravo, bravo on the gorgeous project by Soboba Band. Were there any issues with a tribe being eligible for the virtual aggregated net metering program?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bob Parkins:               This is Bob speaking. No, we had to go through the process of making an application and getting approval from Southern California Edison, and we were able to get approval for all the meters that we requested to be credited towards the tribe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Castello:       There is one issue that we did run into with our – with Edison, our local utility company, is that there was a limitation because the PUC had adopted the regulations for one megawatt per parcel, and when they wrote the regulation, unfortunately, they didn't include anything specific for reservations, for federal lands, specific for Native Americans.</p>
<p>So even though we're on close to 8,000 acres, we were considered one parcel, so we had to go back and kind of work things out with Edison, and that's what took a long time as well, one of the reasons it took a long time, is we were limited to one megawatt, when originally, we had talked to close to eight, possibly ten megawatts, for all our facilities and our homes on the reservation. So that was one restriction that we did run into.</p>
<p>We did get – we were able to negotiate over several months, almost a year, to get – to allow us another couple of megawatts, but they were – but still, they were still restrictive. That restriction is still there. There's still language that needs to be corrected for other reservations and other tribes within California. I'm not sure about the other states. But I know in California that is that restriction, as far as limitations per parcel, and not truly identifying and carving out provisions specifically for Native American tribes and reservations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Great. Thank you. And Jon, a question for you. What USDA programs are compatible with the DOE Tribal Energy Grant? And then if DOE has a response as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                Yeah. I'm not sure – I'm not aware of any incompatibilities, if you will. We're going to finance standalone projects through our US financing. To the extent that we can work with financing from DOE, that's great, because augmenting – well, first off, two federal sources is better than one, and if I understand correctly, with grant funds, that greatly improves the success of the project, particularly since we're coming at it from a lending perspective. So I don't know if energy has anything to add or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Yeah, I would like to add – this is Lizana Pierce. From a grant perspective, there are cost share requirements, typically, and those would require sources from non-federal funds, unless they are allowed by law. There are a tremendous number of statutes that – for various agencies, that provide federal funds that can be used as cost share match, and I try to list many of those in the funding opportunity announcements we issue.</p>
<p>So a lot of the self-governance, the self-compacts, the HUD funds, to name a few. I don't know about USDA. Obviously, they're grant to grant. I don't know if there's legislation that would allow that to be cost shared against each other. But typically, USDA has larger funds and financing capabilities beyond the grant phase for deployment of larger projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                That's true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. What grants or resources are available to help develop a tribal RFP?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            For a solar RFP – this is Lizana again – for a solar RFP, we do have on the Indian Energy website the resource that has a template RFP, specifically for solar, and you can customize that. It also provides links to some modeling tools to incorporate as well. So at least that's a start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           And then how about grants, Lizana?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            To actually create the RFP or – I guess I'm not quite sure what the question is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Yeah, grant funding to actually help develop the RFP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Typically, the whole soliciting and competing of partnerships, some of that can be incorporated in the grant. It depends on the grant. Every funding opportunity announcement is unique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        And I mean – this is Doug. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question in part, but I think our – I know our technical assistance providers and our technical assistance program has helped tribes both develop and refine RFPs, both specifically and their general approach to RFPs. So yeah, if it's not _____ grant, I would recommend the TA program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            And that's where this RFP was developed from, but also part of the technical assistance would be if you would like advice on some of the applications and some of the input, there may be that available as well. And you can apply for the technical assistance online, pretty simple process. And I urge you to look at some of the existing resources that came out of TA for other tribes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        You know, one other comment I'd make here, and it really wasn't discussed in detail, but some of the comments kind of went this direction. Instead of doing an RFP, there are many instances where a request for qualifications can be done much simpler and may achieve the project's or the tribe's objectives in a more efficient manner. And part of that goes to the – to the issue that the first presenter on the RFP on developing – I guess it was our last presenter, discussed, and that is the – oftentimes, the great extent, the cost, the time that it takes to really prepare an effective proposal, where you may be operating in an environment you don't have all the information, and you need to get yourself up to speed technically, financially, and all of the things that the presenter discussed.</p>
<p>So think about – unless you're required to do an RFP, either by tribal law or a particular grant program, I would consider the request for qualifications approach. And you can also discuss that with the TA providers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Great. Thanks, Doug and Lizana. Bob, did you get resistance regarding sharing construction drawings, since these are presumably proprietary documents?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bob Parkins:               Yes, a few of them did object, but they finally came around. These are public documents anyway, so that was our argument that we responded with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Well, this – I'm going to read this question. You somewhat answered it, Doug, but there may not be – you may not have an answer, but we'll see. Any insight on how to use grants such as the DOE Indian Energy grants, without diluting the ITC tax basis? And Lizana, you too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            I would – I wonder if Soboba would like to input the difficulties they had with using the ITC relative to grant funds. Michael, can you guys answer or at least respond to that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deborah DeForge:     Lizana, this is Deb. The biggest hurdle that we run into with the ITC was that, rightfully so, the Department of Energy maintains a vested interest in the equipment until the closeout of the grant. That makes it really difficult to look for an investor who wants to put up capital funds as an investment, knowing that they don't have the last step in ownership of the equipment. And that's ultimately I believe the hurdle that kept us from going that final step and doing the investment tax credit. Anybody else?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Background voices]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deborah DeForge:     Okay. That's it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Thanks, Deb.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Thank you. Okay. For Bob, in the RFP process, did you actually receive completed sets of construction drawings and all the technical project documentation requested? It's similar to the previous one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bob Parkins:               Yes. Out of the six proposals, we had four of them that were very complete, very comprehensive, and there was one that was very – it wasn't as comprehensive, and the last one was kind of like in between. But the answer to your question is they did provide us complete sets. Whether or not they were comprehensive is another issue. And that was one of the things that we were evaluating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Great. Doug, this one's probably for you. If a tribe currently conducts business through a non-distinct legal entity structure and later wants to transfer the business and its assets to a separate legal entity, but still is 100 percent tribally owned, will the Secretary need to review and approve that transfer under Section 81?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Now does the question presume that we're doing this initially under a Section 17 corporation? I missed that part of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Yeah, it doesn't say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        It doesn't say? I'm sorry, Randy. Did you say that wasn't clear?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           No, there's no mention of Section 17.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Oh, well, if it's not done under a Section 17, it does possibly raise that – the issue. I mean, anything that triggers Section 81, there are certain types of contracts that require secretarial approval, certain types of land transfers, contracts going beyond a certain number of years. And so if you were – I think the – so it's not a safe assumption that 81 won't be triggered by that, unless you are under a structure that clearly exempts it in the first place, like the Section 17. I think that's the clearest way I can answer that question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Let me see if Rebecca, who asked that question – she has her hand raised, so let's let her talk to you directly. Just bear with me, Rebecca, while I try to unmute your phone. Rebecca, you're unmuted, if you want to talk to Doug directly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Hi, Doug. I think you did provide the answer to my question. I was wondering about that in a non-Section 17 context, and was presuming the answer would be yes. Of course –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    – when we got closer to that, it –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yeah, I would definitely want to make sure that any kind of transfer does not trigger Section 81, and you'd just need to go back and make sure it doesn't, because if you're operating in a vehicle that doesn't provide a clear exemption, you very well could be subject to those approvals and restrictions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yeah.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thanks, Rebecca. While we're on the raised hands, let's see if there are any other raised hands. Just bear with me while I scroll through the list here. Bob Goff, you got your hand raised. Give me a moment to unmute you, and Bob, go ahead and ask your question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Hello. Can you hear me?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Yes. My question was to the RUS presenter. Would the Rural Utilities Service – well, tribes right now have an obstacle for putting in their own renewable energy projects because they're basically looking at taking away market share from the existing co-ops who are presently serving them. One of the reasons for the concern about the market share is that tribal load has been pledged to the RUS in service to the debt for the coal plants that have been built over the years.</p>
<p>So my question is would the RUS consider some sort of – think of it as the PTC, but instead of getting two cent or two point whatever money is it available, have that pledged to retiring the debt for every kilowatt hour generated by a rural co-op member. I think something along those lines in terms of debt forgiveness, but it's actually paying it back in renewable energy credit, might go a long way to solving both the co-op problem of market share loss and the tribal issues of wanting to become energy independent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. I agree with you. I think the offset there makes sense. We would try not to be onerous about – we looked at a loan and we pledged or we determined it was securitized based on the load that was – it was designed for and what the revenue streams would be. Certainly, removing revenue streams might have an impact on the ability to repay. But I think some sort of mechanism like this could go to offset that.</p>
<p>We certainly want to work with ways to introduce – not only to help the tribal areas become energy independent, if that's what they wish to do, but also to introduce more renewable energy into the electric grid as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, I can't give you a complete thumbs up on it, but I like the proposal, and we'd be willing to work with you to flesh something like that out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Great. I'll be back in touch with you offline. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jon Claffey:                Wonderful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thanks, Bob. Good to hear from you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yeah, and this is Doug. Bob and our RUS folks, please let us know how that conversation goes, because if that becomes a viable pathway, others might be interested in it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Absolutely. But I think if we piloted it just in Indian Country, where both the federal government has special responsibility and looking at it for this carbon offset opportunity, I think we may be able to do something short of onerous legislation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Right. Always a creative thinker, Bob. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Yep. Good. Okay. Let me see if there are any other hands raised. Just bear with me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Doug, in response to that, we were born outside the box, so that's where those ideas come from.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Laughter]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           And Bob, you may want to put your phone on mute, because I can't find your name again to mute you, so you're going to have to mute you on your own end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    I just did. Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Marsha _____, you have your hand raised, and I'm unmuting you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    No, my question was answered. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Oh, you bet. Thanks. All right. Just give me one more moment here to see if there are – Terrence Myer, your hand's raised. Let me unmute you. Go ahead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    Oh, I didn't intend to raise my hand, but I want to say hi to everybody. Hi, Bob. We've worked together in the past. I am always just running into roadblocks when I'm trying to help tribes in finding structures where all the different requirements of the different programs mesh. A couple of those questions earlier were mine. And the problem that the tribe had in connecting the IPC with the project is typical.</p>
<p>I would love it if somewhere there existed a resource in the DOE or USDA or Department of the Interior to kind of – I mean, this is it. We're trying to put together these designed programs, but it's a real issue to try to get everything to work together. And then, of course, you're working with – each tribe has unique _____. So thanks for doing this, I guess is the thing – I don't know if there's any comments on how best to try to sort out all the pieces we have to sort out to make the project work _____ _____.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yeah, this is Doug from Indian Energy, and I really appreciate that comment, because – and I'd like to learn more about it. I think maybe if you – my contact information, I don't know if it's on the website, but we certainly can get it to you. You can reach me through I believe my email address at least is on our website. And I'd like to have a conversation with you about that, because I don't know if you've – if your question might be answered by our handbook that we developed. Randy mentioned it in the opening remarks. We do go into much more detail of how the ITC and the PTC work, and the extension – the extent – the changes that were done in the most recent legislation extending the ITC and PTC didn't really affect this issue. So even though the handbook's a couple of years old now, it still would be relevant on that, in describing the interplay between different types of business structures and the eligibility to weave in the ITC and the PTC.</p>
<p>But with respect to difficulties that folks are running into in being able to accept federal grants in different types of entities, I'd like to learn more about that, because there might be an easy answer, or it might be something we need to actually roll up our sleeves on and take a closer look at.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audience Members:    That'd be great. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yeah.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Thanks. Let me just see if there are any other raised hands, and if not, let me go back to the written questions here. And then we'll conclude. Just make sure – looks like there are just a few more – just bear with me. What was the _____, because other states have similar rules – this may be a two-part question. Let me go up. Just bear with me. How did the – how did SCE and the PUC allow you more than one facility on parcel? That may have already been answered, but if you want to address that again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Castello:       Well, this is Michael from Soboba. I think that's addressed to me, for the limitations that we had on the amount of energy we could produce. What we did, the tribe did, with our council working through Optimum as well, is we went to the PUC presidents themselves. We actually had the – we actually came and met with them, talked with them about what the limitations were. And I think they were kind of – it wasn't something that was actually brought to their attention previously, and so we worked through them, and there was something just – basically, what they said was kind of an oversight at the time, and something that they really didn't anticipate, which was unfortunate. I would hope that when they did write those regulations, they would take into consideration all – there's 110 tribes in California alone, so for them not to take consideration for Native Americans to participate in renewable energy was very disappointing.</p>
<p>But we did have several meetings, not only with the Edison or utility provider but also with the PUC directly, with the presidents themselves. I actually had a couple of meetings and some conference calls, and worked closely with them to rectify or try to rectify, and we're still working in that process as well, something we'll continue on, and hopefully try – what we tried to do is work with – notify other tribes as well to contact the PUC so that they could – you know, they don't run into the same issue moving forward, that we can get some definitely language into the regulations to allow Native American tribes to participate to the extent they need, not just to what they're relegating us to, but to hopefully meet our needs as a tribe.</p>
<p>Because even though we have – we're working on a two megawatt facility, it doesn't meet our entire needs of the reservation, and we'd like to provide not only just the government buildings and our casino and our golf course and our business enterprises, but also our homes and community members as well. But that was a lot of negotiations, a lot of discussions, a lot of meetings back and forth, and just working with them and with our legal team, and all of us coming together at the table, and that's usually what it takes for us to get – move forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           All right. Great. Thank you. And then last question –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Crosstalk]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Oh, go ahead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Castello:       I just wanted to add one more thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brian Orr:                  Yeah, this is Brian Orr, also with Optimum Group. The technical workaround that we've been using is Edison allowed us to basically go by tax ID or business entity. So so long as there's a separate business entity for the tribe, we're able to do one system for each of those.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Great. And last question. Jon, this one's for you. Are rural electrification grants available to tribes connected to a private utility or an investor owned utility for renewable energy projects? For instance – can anyone on the panel hear me?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deborah DeForge:     We can still hear you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Yes, but I don't have the answer to that. That's an interesting question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Yeah, Jon, we're way past our end time, so Jon probably had somewhere else he had to go. So let's just conclude with that. And again, thank you, speakers. Great webinar. And I'm going to put up on the slide deck the next webinar is July 29th, "Life Cycle on Tribal Clean Energy Projects." We hope to see you there. And hope everyone has a great day. Goodbye.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doug MacCourt:        Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Thanks, Randy.</p>
