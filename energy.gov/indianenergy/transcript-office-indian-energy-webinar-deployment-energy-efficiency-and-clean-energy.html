    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div  property="content:encoded" class="field-item odd"> <p>Good morning, or good afternoon – wherever you may be. And welcome to the webinar for DOE's funding opportunity announcement entitled, "Deployment of Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy on Indian Lands – 2017 FOA – F-O-A Number DEFOA0001660." I'm Randy Manion of Western Area Power Administrations Renewable Resource Program, and I'll be assisting with today's webinar. Let's go over some event details. Today's webinar is being recorded and all phones have been muted for this purpose. The audio recording and PowerPoints will be available in a week or two. You'll be notified once those are posted on the Office of Indian Energy website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Be aware that questions will not be entertained during this webinar. This is a competitive opportunity. All questions need to be submitted in writing. So please submit your questions via e-mail directly to Tribal – T-R-I-B-A-L @EE.DOE.gov. We’ll try to keep this webinar to no more than two hours. Our speaker today is Lizana Pierce, who will be briefing you on the funding opportunity announcement. Ms. Pierce is an engineer with the US Department of Energy and a program manager for DOE's office of Indian Energy. And we'll start the webinar now. And Lizana, the virtual floor is now yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you, Randy. And good afternoon and welcome, everyone, to the webinar. This informational webinar is for people interested in applying to the Department of Energy Funding Opportunity Announcement, or FOA, entitled "Deployment of Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy on Tribal Lands 2017," which was issued November 14, 2016. As Randy said, my name is Lizana Pierce, and I'm a senior engineer with the Department of Energy, and program manager of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, otherwise known simply as the Office of Indian Energy.  I've been working in clean energy for the last twenty years plus, and specifically in Indian energy since the late '90s. Under the Office of Indian Energy, I am tasked with implementing the deployment program, specifically for financial assistance. This entails issuing Funding Opportunity Announcements, managing the application review process, administrating the resulting grant, and overseeing the funded tribal energy projects.</p>
<p>The intent of this webinar is to cover the basic aspects of the Funding Opportunity Announcement, again otherwise known as the FOA, and highlight essential details about the application process, including the types of applications sought, who is eligible to apply, cost-share, and other requirements – what the application needs to contain, how to ask questions, and how applications will be selected for funding. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to the e-mail address in the lower right-hand side of the cover page. This is the official mailbox to direct all of your questions to during the entire FOA process. Please do not contact DOE or DOE laboratory staff or contractors directly with any questions, including myself, as all questions must be in writing. The reason for only accepting questions in writing is to ensure you receive a formal response, and so that everyone has the benefit of the same response, because if you have a question, typically the other potential applicants likely have similar questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you will not have a – as we will not have a live Q&amp;A session as part of this webinar, please capture your questions as they come up and send them via e-mail to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. In the subject line of your email, please include the FOA number – DE-FOA-0001660. Unless a similar question has been asked, responses to questions received in this mailbox will be posted to the Frequently Asked Questions webpage for this FOA on the EERE Exchange website. Responses to your questions will typically be posted within about three business days after receipt. Before submitting questions, please check the FAQs webpage on the EERE Exchange website to see if a similar question has already been answered. In submitting the question, please be careful not to include any language that might be business-sensitive, proprietary, or confidential.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your participation in this webinar is completely voluntary. There are no particular advantages or disadvantages to the application evaluation process with respect to your participation in today's webinar. These slides and an audio recording of the webinar will be posted in the next week or so. And as a registrant of the webinar, you'll be notified when this material is available. You may want to download the FOA document now for reference, as I will be referencing specific pages during the webinar. So let's get started. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before we discuss the Funding Opportunity Announcement itself, I wanted to walk you through the EERE Exchange website and where you can find the FOA document itself, application forms, Frequently Asked Questions. The EERE Exchange website is at EERE-Exchange.Energy.gov. And once on that page, scroll down the list until you locate the FOA Number DEFOA0001660. By clicking on the FOA number on the FOA list or table will take you to the section of the webpage specific to this FOA as shown on this slide. As you can see in the slide, the EERE Exchange website, the section specific to this FOA includes a brief summary and other key information. The direct link to this FOA summary is at the bottom of the slide. And my apologies for the legibility of the slide – the screenshot will be expanded in the next few slides. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you could see from this screenshot, the EERE Exchange summary for this FOA includes the FOA document itself, required application documents, contact information for submitting questions regarding the FOA, and for the EERE Exchange support. And a link to the Frequent Asked Questions, or FAQs webpage. And the submission deadline of February 7, 2017 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Remember, this is Eastern Time, so please plan accordingly and adjust for whatever time zone you are located. If the application documents are not shown, you'll need the click on the View Required Application Documents link, under Required Application Documents. Once the View Required Application Documents link is clicked, a list of required application documents will be revealed, which we'll show on the next slide. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, once you click on the View Required Application Documents, you'll see the various forms that need to be included as part of your application. Note that these are not the entirety of forms and documents that compose a complete application. The forms on Exchange only comprise part of an application and in an of themselves do not make a complete application.  Further into the presentation, we'll go through all of the elements that comprise a complete application. The forms include the Application for Federal Assistance, the SF – pardon me, SF424, which is a fillable PDF form, the Budget Justification, IE335, which is a multi-tab Microsoft Excel workbook for capturing budget details, the Summary Slide template, which is a PowerPoint slide intended to summarize your proposed project, the Work Plan, which is a Microsoft Word template to be used in preparing the work plan for your proposed project, and the Project Metrics Data File, which is an Excel file that captures key information on your project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, there's the Energy Savings Calculations, which is the multi-tab Microsoft Excel workbook for calculating energy savings. Note that this is only required for those applying to Topic Area One. And finally, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, SFLLL, which is a Word document. If this does not apply to you, please indicate, "not applicable," sign, date, and include this as a part of your application. We'll talk a little bit more of that later in the presentation. All other components comprising the complete application will be self-generated. And for a complete list of the application content, see the table on pages 26 and 27 of the FOA. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The answers to all FOA-related questions received in our e-mail box, which was <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>, will be posted on the Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs webpage specific to this FOA on the EERE Exchange website. This slide shows an example of the FAQ page. Please check this page periodically, as questions and answers will continue to be posted throughout the entire time the FOA is open. Please also check this page before submitting a question, as a similar question may have already been answered. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This slide shows the anticipated schedule for the FOA, which is also on the cover page of the FOA document. The FOA has already been posted and we are conducting the FOA informational webinar now. All applications are due on the EERE Exchange website no later than 5:00 Eastern on February 7, 2017. Note that the closing time is 5:00 Eastern. Remember that this is Eastern Time, so again, please plan accordingly and adjust for whichever time zone you are located. Also note the DOE will not extend the submission deadline for applications that fail to submit required information due to server connection congestion. Also, the EERE Exchange is designed to enforce the deadline specific to this FOA. So the Apply and Submit buttons may automatically disable at the defined submission deadline. Therefore, please ensure you begin uploading your application. We recommend at least 48 hours in advance of the submission deadline to ensure you meet that deadline, and to allow at least an hour to submit an application. Once the application is submitted to EERE Exchange, you may revise or update your application up until the expiration deadline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DOE anticipates notifying applicants selected for negotiation of an award on or about May 2017, and making awards approximately 90 days after receipt of any requested supplemental information. Each and every applicant will receive a notification letter by e-mail to the technical and administrative points of contact designated by the applicant in the EERE Exchange system. Notification letters, again sent to each and every applicant, will state whether the application is determined to be non-compliant, which is an incomplete or late application, whether it's ineligible and doesn't meet the eligibility requirements beginning on Page 15 of the FOA document, if it's non-responsive – see Section 1C beginning on Page 12 for applications specifically not of interest – also, whether your application is not selected for funding, selection is postponed, not selected, but designated as an alternate, or selected for negotiation towards an award. Each and every notification letter will state the basis on which those decisions were made. Again, each and every applicant will receive a notification letter relative to their application. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To apply to this FOA, the applicants must register with and submit application materials through EERE Exchange at the URL shown here. As previously discussed, Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs for this FOA can be found on the FAQ page specific to the FOA. Please also consider registering in Grants.gov at <a href="http://www.Grants.gov">www.Grants.gov</a> – pardon me, so that you'll receive automatic updates when amendments to the FOA are posted, if any. Note that applications will only be accepted through EERE Exchange, not through Grants.gov. Thank you. So the EERE Exchange registration does not have a delay. However, the remaining registration requirements could take several weeks to process, and our necessary for potential applicants to receive an award under this FOA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although not required in order to submit an application through the EERE Exchange site, all potential applicants lacking a DUNS number or have not yet registered in SAMS or FedConnect should complete those registrations as soon as possible. And you can see Part 6B of the FOA on Pages 58 and 59 for information on how to register to those systems. So this is really important. We recently had a situation where we were unable to make an award because the SAMS registration had not been completed. And unfortunately, the fiscal year-end was looming. Thankfully, that registration was completed, but just in time for an award to be made before the fiscal year-end. So again, I stress please register in these systems as soon as possible. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So all applicants are strongly encouraged to carefully read the Funding Opportunity Announcement, and to adhere to the stated submission requirements. This presentation summarizes the contents of the FOA. However, if there are any inconsistencies between the FOA and this presentation, or statements by DOE personnel, the FOA is the controlling document and applicants should rely on the FOA language or seek clarification – and clarification through submitting an e-mail to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. If you believe there are any inconsistencies, please contact us at that e-mail I just stated. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the agenda for this webinar is as shown. First, we'll provide a summary of the FOA, discuss applications specifically not of interest, award information. We'll go over eligibility. We'll go over cost-sharing requirements, discuss the content and the form for a complete application, application eligibility, the merit review and selection criteria and process, registration requirements – which we briefly just covered, application submission and points of contact, how to submit your questions, and some recommendations, and best practices. We'll also go over the energy savings calculations which are specific to Topic Area One only applicants. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FOA Executive Summary included on Page One of the FOA document as shown here includes information on the FOA. This information is summarized on this and the next slide. We'll go over all of this information as part of the presentation, but is provided here as a summary. And I'll give you a moment to read through the slide now. Next slide, please. Continued on this slide, and again, on Page One of the FOA are additional key information relative to this funding opportunity. Note that there is a 50 percent cost-share requirement, meaning that 50 percent of the total allowable cost of the project. The total cost of the project are the sum of the DOE share and the recipient's share of all allowable cost. For instance, if a proposed project is estimated to cost $500,000.00, the required cost-share would be $250,000.00, or 50 percent of the total project cost of $500,000.00. Also be aware that you may submit more than one application to the FOA or more than one application for a particular topic area, provided that each application is for a distinctly different project and addresses only one topic area. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So a goal of the DOE Office of Indian Energy is to strengthen tribal communities to sustain future generations. Specifically, the office is charged with promoting Indian tribal energy development efficiency and use, reducing or stabilizing energy costs, enhancing and strengthening Indian tribal energy and economic infrastructure, and bringing electrical power and services to Indian land. For more information on the Office of Indian Energy policy and programs, please see our website at <a href="http://www.Energy.gov">www.Energy.gov</a>\IndianEnergy. Next slide, please. Now this Funding Opportunity Announcement, or FOA, builds on efforts by DOE to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology on Indian land. Between 2002 and 2016, DOE invested nearly $66.5 million dollars on more than 200 tribal energy projects implemented across the contiguous 48 states and in Alaska. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specifically, the Office of Indian Energy is soliciting applications from Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Regional Corporations, and Village Corporations, hereafter referred to as an Indian tribe, as well as tribal energy resource development organizations to – number one, install energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems on tribal buildings under Topic Area One, or to deploy clean energy systems on a community scale, which is Topic Area Two. Under Topic Area One, there are two subtopic areas, each requiring energy efficiency measures. The first is deep energy retrofit, which is Topic Area 1A, or energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems, which is Topic Area 1B. As indicated per statute, only Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Regional Corporations, and Village Corporations, and tribal energy resource development organizations are eligible to apply under this FOA. However, in future slides we will address who and how different entities might be able to submit an application on behalf of an Indian tribe or tribes. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specifically, the Office of Indian Energy is soliciting applications from – hmm, just a second. [laughs] I think I – I think I had an extra slide in there. Let's keep going. Next slide. Next slide. So under Topic Area One, there are two subtopic areas, each requiring energy efficiency measures. The first is deep energy retrofit, Topic Area 1A, or energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems, which is Topic Area 1B. All proposed installations under Topic Area One must be for either existing tribal and – pardon me, existing tribally-owned or controlled buildings, or tribally-owned or controlled buildings that are currently be constructed, or plan to be constructed during the proposed grant period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the purpose of this announcement, tribal buildings may include a single or multiple tribally-owned or controlled buildings, located on Indian land. Tribally-owned or controlled buildings for the purposes of this FOA, is a building or buildings where the eligible entity has the authority to retrofit the building and where the building is either owned by the eligible entity or tribal members, or the eligible entity has a long-term lease – at least 20 years. Buildings may include, but are not limited to tribal member homes, schools, community buildings, clinics, tribal government buildings, utility facilities, such as WIC, wastewater system, tribal casinos, or tribal businesses. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For – so Topic Area 1A – deep energy retrofit. A deep energy retrofit for purposes of Topic Area 1A is a whole-building approach involving the comprehensive renovation or remodeling strategy that combines multiple energy efficiency measures. Only projects proposing multiple EEMs – energy efficiency measures, will be considered. If an application proposes only a single EEM under Topic Area 1A, the application will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered. Energy efficiency measures for purposes of this FOA means the implementation of either building efficiency, or industrial process efficiencies. So see Page 6 or Appendix A for further definition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, energy efficiency is not the same as energy conservation, which is not eligible under this FOA. Specifically, energy conservation for purposes of this FOA means decreasing energy consumption by using less of an energy service, or going without an energy service to save energy. Energy conservation typically involves the behavioral change, and may include meters or other integrators to induce that behavior change. If energy conservation is proposed in response to Topic Area 1A, the application will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So each topic area or subtopic area has specific requirements. For Topic Area 1A deep energy retrofit, it must be based on a prior energy audit or industrial assessment, and those energy audits and industrial energy assessments must be provided as part of the application. It must also use commercially-proven, warrantied technology. And you can see the definitions under Appendix A for those terms. Under Topic Area 1A deep energy retrofits you'll also need to demonstrate the potential at a least a 15 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used. So that's the total of all energy and fuel sources combined for a building, including but not limited to electricity, propane, heating oil, diesel oil, natural gas, or any other energy or fuel a building might use. Please also note that the 15 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used in a building or buildings must occur during the period of performance of the grant, and verification of the actual annual reduction – the amount, cost, and percentage, and the total of all energy used in the buildings – will be required for a minimum of 12 months after installation of the deep energy retrofits, and a description of those verification methods must be included as part of the technical volume.</p>
<p>And the 15 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used in a building must be based on the actual annual consumption of all energy and fuel sources used during a prior consecutive 12-month period, as evidenced by utility bills. That evidence may include a summary of electric utility consumption and cost as provided by a local utility, which is preferred, could include electrical utility invoices or bills, fuel purchase invoices, or other comparable documents for all energy and fuel sources used in the building or buildings. For tribally-owned or controlled buildings that are currently being constructed or plan to be constructed during the grant period, the requirements for a 15 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used must be based on the projected annual energy and fuel use, and those projections applied as part of the application. Note that only the incremental cost associated with the installation of the energy efficiency measures will be considered, not the cost of the building being constructed or to be constructed. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems, Topic Area 1B. Under Topic Area 1B, a clean energy system or systems can be proposed, in addition to a single or multiple energy efficiency measure. To be eligible, the combination of a single and multiple EEM and clean energy systems must use commercially-proven, warrantied technology – again, you can see those definitions in the FOA and under Appendix A – and you must demonstrate the potential of at least 20 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used. Next slide, please. Additionally, under Topic Area 1B, which are energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems, the energy efficiency measures must be based on a prior energy audit or audits for industrial energy assessment or assessments. And those energy audits or industrial energy assessments must be provided as part of the application. Additionally, the clean energy system must not only contribute towards meeting the 20 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used, but it must also be a minimum of 10 kilowatt-rated capacity, or equivalent for heating and cooling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As was the case under Topic Area 1A, for Topic Area 1B the 20 percent reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used in an existing building or buildings must be based on the actual annual consumption of all energy and fuel sources during a prior consecutive 12-month period, as evidenced by utility bills. And for buildings that are currently being constructed or plan to be constructed during the grant period, the requirement for a 20 percent reduction in the total of all energy used in a building or buildings must be based on the projected annual energy and fuel use, and those projections supplied as part of the application. Furthermore, the verification of the actual energy reduction amount cost and percentage, and the total of all energy and fuel use will be required for a minimum of 12 months after the installation of the energy efficiency measures and the clean energy system, and a description of those verification methods must be included as part of the technical volume. Slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So going on to Topic Area Two, which is the community-scale clean energy deployment. Under this topic area, DOE is seeking applications for the deployment of community-scale clean energy systems, which are the renewable energy power systems, or combined heat and power systems on Indian lands to provide electricity and/or heating or cooling to many buildings or to an entire tribal community. For purposes of this FOA, community-scale means a project serving a substantial number of the total buildings within a community, however, no less than three buildings, and/or providing a substantial percentage of the total consumption – or pardon me, total community energy load, but it must be a minimum of 250 kilowatts, or the BTU equivalent. For the purposes of this FOA, substantial means an ample or considerable amount. You can see these definitions under Appendix A. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So again, on to Topic Area Two, any single clean energy system, or the total of multiple systems proposed under this topic area must be a minimum of 250 kilowatt-rated capacity, or for heating and cooling, the BTU equivalent. It must affect a substantial number of buildings within the tribal community, which is no less than three, and use commercially-proven, warrantied technology. Note that as part of the technical volume, an explanation and rationale as to how the proposed project meets the community-scale requirement specifically addressing the substantial element will be required. Clean energy systems for purposes of this FOA include renewable energy systems, and combined heat and power systems. And you can see those definitions on Pages 9 and 10 and under Appendix A. Applications under Topic Area Two must demonstrate the availability of the resource, whether it be renewable or natural gas, and the applications proposing geothermal of biomass systems must also demonstrate the sustainability of the resource. The minimum System Five – 250 kilowatt-rated capacity or equivalent – may be for either single individual clean energy systems, or the aggregate of multiple clean energy systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All proposed projects or facilities on which systems are proposed must be on Indian land, must be owned or controlled by the eligible entity, and must benefit the eligible entity, whether it be an Indian tribe or a tribal energy resource development organization, and benefit the tribal community. However, a substantial number of buildings within the tribal community – no less than three – where the energy or heat is to be used do not necessarily need to be owned or controlled by the eligible entity. Also, verification of the actual annual electric power generation and/or heating or cooling provided will be required for a minimum of twelve months after installation of the clean energy systems. And a description of those verification methods must also be included as part of the technical volume. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now please review the applications specifically not of interest on Pages 13 and 14 of the FOA, and included here and on the next slide, as those applications will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered. And I'll give you a moment to review those applications not of interest. Next slide, please. And here are additional examples of applications specifically not of interest. And I'll give you a moment again to read through the slide. Next slide, please. Oh, crud. Oh, and I do see the – I do have a – goodness gracious. It looks like I have another slide that's out of order, too. I apologize for that. We'll clean that up before we post the slides. Going on to award information, the award information included in this slide is also included as part of the executive summary included on Page 1 of the FOA document. Please note that there are different restrictions on the minimum and maximum amount of DOE funding to be requested under each topic area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Topic Area One, which is to install energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems on tribal buildings, DOE anticipates making three to five awards, with the DOE funding for individual awards varying from no less than $50,000.00 to a maximum of $500,000.00.  However, for Topic Area Two, community-scale clean energy development, DOE anticipates making three to five awards with the DOE funding amount per individual award varying from no less than $250,000.00 to a maximum of a million dollars. The actual level of funding to be awarded under this FOA, if any, depends upon congressional appropriations. Please note there's a 12-month verification period required after the installation of the proposed systems. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now we'll go over eligibility information. Eligibility for awards under this Funding Opportunity Announcement is restricted to an Indian tribe or a tribal energy resource development organization on whose Indian lands the projects will be located. Although only Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Regional Corporations and Village Corporations, and tribal energy resource development organizations are eligible under this FOA, other entities to be discussed on an upcoming slide may be able to submit an application on behalf of an Indian tribe or tribes, provided they provide documentation that authorizes them to submit on behalf of the Indian tribe or tribes. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the definition of Indian tribe is as shown here on this slide. Note that an Indian tribe for purposes of this FOA includes any Alaska native village, Alaska Native Regional Corporation, or Village Corporation, as defined here, and that an eligible Indian tribe, including Alaska Native villages, but not the Alaska Regional Corp. or Village Corp. must be federally recognized, as listed in the Indian entities recognized and eligible to receive services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. And this is published by the Department of Interior's BIA in the federal register on May 4, 2016. And once we post the slides, you'll have the link for that list. There's 567 Indian tribes and Alaska native villages on that list. Also, a tribal consortium of pleural of consortia for purposes of this FOA means a group of Indian tribes as defined above that are chosen to submit a single application. Under this announcement, a tribal consortium is eligible to submit an application provided the application is submitted by a single Indian tribe representing the consortium. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As previously stated, although only Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Regional Corps. and Village Corps. and tribal energy resource development organizations are eligible to apply under this FOA, tribal organizations and inner tribal organizations as defined here and in the FOA may submit an application on behalf of an Indian tribe of tribes provided they provide documentation that authorizes them to submit on behalf of an Indian tribe or tribes. Although I don't need to read the slide for you, I want to ensure that any entity defined under this FOA as a tribal organization understands the requirements. As stated here, a tribal organization for purposes of this announcement means any legally established organization of an Indian tribe which is controlled, sanctioned, or chartered by the recognized governing body of that Indian tribe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A tribal organization may include, but is not limited to a subsidiary, a subdivision, or instrumentality of an Indian tribe which is established under either congressional, state, or tribal law to act on behalf or an Indian tribe. Evidence of the authority for a tribal organization to submit an application on behalf of Indian tribe or tribes may include, but is not limited to a constitution, a resolution, an ordinance, an executive order, a charter, or other legal documentation. Please note that DOE will determine the sufficiency of an authorization based on the evidence submitted as part of the application. DOE will not make eligibility determinations prior to the date on which the application to the FOA are submitted. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As with the tribal organization, intertribal organizations as defined here and in the FOA may submit an application on behalf of an Indian tribe or tribes, provided evidence of that authority is provided as part of the application. Note that intertribal organizations may include, but are not limited to intertribal councils, regional tribal organizations or associations, Alaska Regional Development Organizations, orders, and tribal federations. Evidence may include, but is not limited to a resolution, an ordinance, an executive order, a charter, Public Law  93-638 contract, self-governance compact, or other legal documentation. Again, DOE is not going to make sufficiency determinations prior to an application being submitted. Next slide, please. In addition to Indian tribes, tribal energy resource development organizations are eligible applicants. And I'll give you just a moment to review that definition. Projects must also be on Indian lands to be eligible. And please see Pages 17 and 18 of the FOA document, or Appendix A for a complete definition of Indian land. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So questions regarding eligibility. DOE will not make eligibility determinations for potential applicants prior to the date on which applications to this FOA must be submitted. The decision of whether to submit an application in response to this FOA lies solely with the applicant. Next slide, please. Thank you. Next under cost-sharing. Under this Funding Opportunity Announcement, required cost-share must be at least 50 percent of the total allowable costs of the project, where total allowable costs of the project is the sum of the DOE's share and the recipient's share of allowable cost. Again, for example, if the requested DOE costs are $250,000.00, the cost-share would be $250,000.00, or 50 percent of the total proposed project cost of $500,000.00, not 50 percent of the DOE requested amount. Again, cost-share is 50 percent of the total project cost, which in this example are $500,000.00. To assist applicants in calculating proper cost-share amounts, DOE has included additional cost-share information in Appendix B of the FOA. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So all cost-share must come from non-federal sources, unless otherwise allowed by law. Included here and in the FOA on Pages 19 are a few instances where federal funds can be used as non-federal cost-share, specifically, funding under the Indian Self-Determination Act, tribal self-governance funding agreements, self-determination contract funding, compact funding, and the HOSTA fund. And if the funds being proposed is non-federal cost-share against this announcement or from a federal source allowed by law, you as the applicant must specifically identify those funds and to provide as part of the application evidence of that authority that allows those funds to be used as non-federal cost-share. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The total budget presented in the application must include both federal, the DOE, and the non-federal or cost-share which combined reflect the total project costs. Again, the total budget presented must include both DOE as well as cost-share. All costs must be verifiable from the recipient's record and be necessary and reasonable for the accomplishment of the project. And as all sources of cost-share are considered part of total project cost, the cost-share dollars will be scrutinized under the same federal regulations as the federal dollars to the project. Next slide, please. Thank you. So cost-share must be allowable, and must be verifiable at the time of submission of the application. So please refer to this chart for your entity's applicable cost principles. It is imperative that you follow the applicable cost principles when creating your budget for the application. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So cost-share can be provided in the form of cash or as in-kind contributions, and can be provided by the recipient, subcontractors, or a third party. Allowable in-kind contributions may include, but are not limited to the contribution of time, unrecovered indirect cost – unless it's – you use the 10 percent minimum, unrecovered facilities and administrative cost, rental value of a building or equipment – not the purchase price, just the rental value – and the value of a service or other resource, or third party in-kind contributions. Now note that the applicant's contribution of time is actually considered a cash contribution. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So be aware that there are items that are considered unallowable cost-share. And if the cost is considered unallowable, it cannot be requested from DOE or counted as cost-share. And this slide provides some examples of cost-share that is unallowable. And I'll give you a moment. Also, want to take note of the fourth and fifth bullet. So generally, any cost before or after the DOE grant period cannot be considered a cost-share. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So next on to content and format of an application. So applications must include the items shown here, the first being the application for federal assistance or Form SF424, which is a formal application form signed by an authorized representative of the applicant. By signing this form, the authorized representative is making certain certifications and assurances. Therefore, the form must be printed, signed, and scanned before being uploaded as part of your application. Note that all forms can be obtained from the EERE Exchange webpage under the Required Application Documents. By clicking the Required Application Documents hyperlink, the FOA forms are revealed and can then be downloaded, completed, and then submitted as part of your application. The second item shown here is a Summary for Public Release. Applicants are required to submit a one-page summary of the proposed project for public release. Again, no proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The third is the summary slide. It's a single PowerPoint slide that provides quick facts about the proposed project. Slide content requirements are provided in the FOA, and a template is provided as part of the required application documents on the EREE Exchange. The fourth item is the technical volume, which is the key submission describing the proposed project and addressing the merit review criteria. The technical volume must not exceed 15 pages. However, that excludes the cover page and table of contents, and DOE will only review the first 15 pages. So please see the table on Pages 29 through 37 of the FOA document for specific content and format of the technical volume. It provides, in detail, what that technical volume should contain. Briefly though, the technical volume should include a cover page, the instructions on Page 29 – the cover page is not accounted against the 15-page limit – table of contents – again, not counted against the page limit – and it will include an executive summary, a project description and outcome, and roles, responsibilities, and capabilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fifth item shown, which is also a required element of an application, is not part of the technical volume, but is being complete – included, pardon me – included as an attachment. The work plan should describe the work to be accomplished and how the applicant will achieve project milestones. The work plan must not exceed five pages, however, that excludes the milestone table, and you should see Pages 38 and 39 of the FOA for specific content of a work plan. Also, be aware that a work plan template has been provided in the EERE Exchange webpage under Required Application Documents, and Appendix C of the FOA provides detailed instructions as well. And we'll discuss the various attachments and additional elements of an application on the next slide. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So during the submittal of your application in the EERE Exchange, the files are donated – denoted as required or optional. But be aware that files designated as optional on the slide and in the EERE Exchange may actually be necessary to complete your application and to fully address the merit review criteria. We'll briefly go through each of these attachments, so bear with me as there's a lot of data. So the first is a Site and Resource Math and Graphics file. This attachment is optional, but may be used to supply any graphics or supplemental information to your technical volume, including maps, photographs, or other visuals of the project location, or buildings affected by the proposed project. You can include evidence of the availability and sustainability of renewable resources, if natural gas is applicable, including resource maps and quantitative resource data. Evidence may also be in the form of a previously completed resource of feasibility study, and any supplemental information or supporting studies should be included here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Project Metrics Data file is a required file. And this file needs to include specific project-related data, including the type of technology capabilities, number of buildings, installed capacity of clean energy systems, cost, square footage of the buildings affected, electricity reliability data, et cetera. We have included a Microsoft Excel template – it has been provided in EERE Exchange – to obtain that information. So the next three attachments are only required for Topic Area One. So anyone applying under Topic Area Two – pardon me, will not need to submit these particular attachments. So again, the first is the Energy Savings Calculations file. This file is intended to demonstrate the potential of reduction in the total of all energy and fuel sources used in a tribally-owned or controlled building or buildings. The methodology included in Appendix C must be used to calculate the energy savings. And see more on Page 40 of the FOA document and in Appendix C. Remember, we have provided the Microsoft Excel template to assist you in these calculations, and that can be downloaded from EERE Exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fourth one is the Energy Use Data file. It's required for Topic Area One. And this includes a summary and evidence of the energy and fuel sources used in the building by month for 12 consecutive months, for each building affected. Energy and fuel sources include, but are not limited to electricity, propane, heating and oil, diesel oil, natural gas, or any other energy or fuel used, including the amount and cost by energy source or fuel type. For more on this file, see Pages 40 and 41 of the FOA document. Evidence to be included as part of this file may include, but is not limited to a summary of electric utility consumption and cost as provided by a local utility – which is preferred, electric utility invoices or bills, fuel purchase invoices, or other comparable documentation, or of energy and fuel sources used in the building. Also for applications being submitted under Topic Area One, as we indicated before, energy audits or industrial energy assessments for each building affected are required as part of the application to support the estimated energy savings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As previously indicated, the three attachments – the three previous attachments we've discussed, which were the Energy Savings Calculation file, the Energy Use Data file, and the energy audit or industrial energy assessment were for Topic Area One only, whereas the remaining attachments may apply to both Topic Area One or Topic Area Two. Moving on, the sixth one would be the Design and Engineering file. And this is intended to include copies of hardware performance specs, warranties, energy drawings – pardon me, engineering drawings, and any other design or engineering data to supplement your technical volume. The requisite material and/or equipment list for any proposed energy efficiency measures should also be included here. The seventh is the Economics file. This should include any supplemental data to support your economic analysis, including as a minimum, a cash flow analysis, unless included as part of the technical volume, and copies of actual utility fuel bills – one for each season needs to be included as part of this attachment. These seasonal utility or fuel bills are specific to the Economic Analysis, whereas the bills included under the Energy Use Data file will be used to verify the estimated energy savings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The eighth attachment here shown is a Statement of Commitment by the applicant and all other project participants, excluding vendors. It is required as part of the application. For Indian tribes, including Alaska native villages, the Statement of Commitment must be in the form of an executive tribal council resolution. If an Indian tribe provides a commitment in a format other than a tribal council resolution, evidence of the statutory or other legal authority authorizing that form of commitment in lieu of a tribal council resolution must accompany that commitment. The evidence must prove that the commitment submitted carries the same level of tribal leadership commitment as a tribal council resolution. For tribal energy resource development organizations, or Alaska Regional Corps., or Village Corps., the statement of commitment may be in the form of a declaration or resolution signed by an authorized representative able to commit the entity. For all other participants, a letter of commitment must be provided as part of the application.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All tribal council resolutions, declarations, resolutions, and letters of commitment must be specific to this Funding Opportunity Announcement, and include a statement of the level and type of cautionary commitment. Failure to submit the appropriate tribal council resolutions, declarations, resolutions, or letters of commitment with your application may result in your application not being reviewed or considered. Statements of commitment by applicants must authorize the submittal of the application, commit to the proposed project, identify the amount and source of cost-share, and include a statement of commitment for the requisite cost-share. Letters of support by anyone not participating in the proposed project are not required or desired, and should not be provided as part of the application. For more, see Pages 41 and 42 of the FOA document.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ninth attachment on this slide, the Subcontract Plan, is only required if a project participant, consultants, contractors, or vendors have not been identified. The plan should include a description of the selection process to be employed, the statement of work for the proposed participant, and the criteria to be used for selection. The Subcontract Plan may be supplemented with excerpts from the applicant Procurement Policy and Procedures document. The tenth attachment is your resume. It is required for each key person proposed, including the applicant's technical contact, business contact, tribal staff, consultants, subcontractor representatives or other key people. In this case, a key person is any individual who contributes in a substantive, measurable way to the execution of the project. Each resume must not exceed two pages. And so you'd need to save all those resumes in a single file for uploading with your application. Again, note that the files designated as optional on this slide and in EERE Exchange may actually be necessary to complete your application and to fully address the merit review criteria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving on. The Budget Justification Workbook, which is Form IE335, is a required form, and must include both the funds being requested from DOE, as well as those proposed with cost-share. Let me repeat that – the budget and budget justification must reflect all project costs, regardless of whether those funds are being requested from DOE or provided cost-share. The form itself is a multi-tab Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. And in addition to the proposed cost, the form requests the basis of estimate for those costs being proposed. The form can be downloaded from the EERE Exchange website. The twelfth attachment – application – applicants must provide a separate budget justification, which is Form IE335 – for each sub-awardee, which is a sub-recipient or subcontractor, excluding vendors – that is expected to perform more than $250,000.00 or 25 percent of the total work effort, whichever is less. Remember that the budget justification must address the total project cost – the funds being requested from DOE, as well as those proposed with cost-share.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the Budget Support file is an optional file. However, if submitted, you may include documentation such as indirect rate agreement, breakdown of fringe costs, vendor or contractor quote which exceeds $250,000.00, or other relevant supplemental budget information. The disclosure of lobbying activities, which is Form SFLLL, is required to be submitted regardless of whether funds are being paid or will be paid for influencing or attempting to influence persons in connection with this application. Recipients or sub-recipients may not use any federal funds to influence or attempt to influence directly or indirectly congressional action on any legislative or appropriation matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All applicants are required to complete and submit the SFAAA, which is the disclosure of lobbying activities, and disclose if any non-federal funds have been paid or will be paid to any person influencing or attempting to influence any of the following in connection with your application – an officer or employee of any federal agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress. If no non-federal funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence any of the above in connection with your application, indicate "None," and sign and date the form. Again, this form is also available under the required application documents on the EERE Exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, last one. All work under DOE funding agreements must be performed in the United States. This requirement does not apply to purchasers of supplies or equipment, so a waiver would not be required for foreign purchases of these items. However, the recipients, if an award is made, should make every effort to purchase supplies and equipment within the United States. However, if work is to be performed outside the US, a waiver must be requested. For more on the content of that waiver, see Section 4I3 beginning on Page 47 of the FOA document. To ensure you are submitting a complete application, I would urge you to use the table on Pages 26 and 27 of the FOA document as a checklist. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[Laughs] Application eligibility requirements. As we previously pointed out, applicants must submit applications no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time on February 7, 2017. Again note that's 5:00 PM Eastern Time, so please plan accordingly adjust for your time zone. Once applications are submitted, DOE will conduct an eligibility review and an application will be deemed eligible only if the application is – the applicant is an eligible entity. Refer to Section 3A of the FOA beginning on Page 15. Another eligibility requirement is cost-share, so you can see that on Section 3B on Pages 18 and 19 of the FOA. So the required cost-share must be 50 percent of the total allowable cost of the project. Remember, the sum of both DOE share and the recipient share of allowable cost equals the total allowable cost of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The third element is the application is eligible if it is – if it complies with the content and form requirement, and the applicant successfully uploads all required documents and clicks the "Submit" button in the EERE Exchange system by the deadline – in other words, a complete application submitted by the deadline. And you can see those requirements in Section 3C beginning on Page 22 in the FOA. Also, an application is eligible if the proposed project is responsive to the intent of the FOA. So see Section 1 and Sections 3D of the FOA. Specifically, any application not responsive to the intent of the FOA as described in Sections 1A and 1B, or identified as specifically not of interest as described in Section 1C will not be deemed – pardon me, will be deemed non-responsive and not reviewed or considered. Also finally, the applicant is eligible if it meets the eligibility requirements listed in Section 3 of the FOA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So please be aware the DOE will not make eligibility requirements prior to the date on which the applications are due. Again, the decision whether to submit an application or response lies solely with the applicant – in other words, DOE will not advise you or make a determination on whether your entity or your proposed projects are eligible. So please do not seek advice from any DOE employee or DOE laboratory staff on those eligibility. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Merit review and selection process. The merit review and selection process consists of a series of reviews, including the initial eligibility review that we just went over, a rigorous technical review, and a programmatic review. The rigorous technical reviews are conducted by reviewers that are experts in the subject matter of the FOA. Ultimately though, the selection official considers the recommendations of the reviewers, along with other considerations, such as program policies – factors which we'll discuss in a moment – to make the selection decision. Next.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this slide shows the multi-tier review process, beginning with the eligibility review. There's a independent review, independent reviewer meeting, followed by a federal consensus board, which is technical, merit determination, then the federal consensus executive board, which reviews – considers programmatic and policy factors and makes recommendations for selection. And finally, the selection official makes selections for negotiation of awards. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So next, we'll go over the merit review criteria, or what your application will be reviewed against. The four criterion are goals or objectives, which is weighted at ten percent, project description and outcomes, which is weighted at 40 percent, roles and responsibilities, capabilities, and commitment, which is weighted at 30 percent, and finally, your work plan, which is weighted at 20 percent. So please see Pages 51 through 53 of the technical merit review criteria, if you are following along in the FOA document. Also note that the content of the technical volume as describe in the table on Pages 29 through 37, and the content of the work plan described in the table beginning on Page 38 – these tables follow the same order and describe the required content on which this criteria will be applied. And I'll give you a moment to read through the slide. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So criteria two, or the project description and outcomes, is weighted at 40 percent, and includes four sub-criteria, the first one being clarity and completeness of the detailed project description, the technical viability of the proposed project, the economic viability of the proposed project, and finally, the outcome. Note that the last three sub-criteria include multiple elements that that criterion will be reviewed against. And I'll give you a moment to read through the sub-criteria on this slide and on the next. Next slide, please. And here are the last two sub-criteria that compromise criterion two, and I'll give you just a moment again to read through those.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The third criterion, which is roles, responsibilities, capabilities, and commitment, is weighted at 30 percent, and it includes the soundness of the project management approach, and the demonstrated level of commitment of the applicant, and each participating organization. And that level of commitment is evidenced by past energy-related efforts and commitments to the proposed project as evidenced by letters of commitment, such as the tribal council resolution. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the fourth and final criterion is the work plan, and it's weighted at 20 percent. So the work plans will be reviewed on the clarity completeness of the narrative description of each activity necessary to complete the project, and the likelihood of achieving the project objectives through logical task structure. Next slide. So as we discussed, the selection official may consider the merit review recommendation, the program policy factors, and the amount of funds available in arriving at selection decisions for this FOA. Next, on to selections and program policy factors. Next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the merit review process, the selection official may consider program policy factors, which are shown here, to come to his or her final selection decision. The program policy factors are included here and on Pages 53 and 54 of the FOA. And again, I'll give you a moment to read through those. Please also see the FOA for additional information on the Tribal Climate Action Champion and those Indian tribes designated under the Promise Zone Initiative. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So to apply for this FOA, applicants must register and submit application materials through EERE Exchange, which is at EERE-Exchange.Energy.gov. A control number will be assigned while you're registering in the EERE Exchange. You need to retain this number, as it will be used as an identifier, and will be required on all application documents. That's why one of the initial steps if you're even contemplating applying for this application is to obtain the control number. So the EERE Exchange registration does not have a delay. However, the remaining registration requirements in the table could take several weeks to process and are necessary for potential applicants to receive an award under this FOA. Therefore, although not required in order to submit an application, all potential applicants lacking a DUNS number or not yet registered with SAMS or FedConnect should complete those registrations as soon as possible, as if selected, an award cannot be made without these registrations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the DUNS number. You need to obtain a DUNS – Dunn and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System – or DUNS number through the website link shown. SAM, which is the System for Award Management – you need to register in the system for Award Management System, or SAM, designated in the electronic business point of contact, which is called an EBiz POC, and obtain a special password called an MPIN, which are important steps in the SAMS registration. SAM registration must be updated annually, and this system includes the banking information that allows reimbursement of costs, so pretty important. FedConnect – register in FedConnect to create an organizational account. Your organization's SAM MPIN obtained during the SAM registration is required to register in FedConnect. For more information about the SAM MPIN, or other registration requirements, review the FedConnect Ready, Set, Go Guide, which can be obtained from the FedConnect Site. Note that all documents associated with any award will only be available through the FedConnect system and, therefore, is required if an award is made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So finally, the Grants.gov. You need to register in Grants.gov to receive any automatic updates when amendments to this FOA are posted. However, please note that applications will not be accepted through Grants.gov. For more on these registrations, see Pages 58 and 59 in the FOA document. Next slide, please. All required submissions must come through EERE Exchange. DOE will not review or consider applications submitted through any other means. Please use the user guide for applying to the Department of Energy Funding Opportunity Announcement, found on the EERE Exchange under Manuals. This is a step-by-step guide including screenshots on how to register and how to submit an application in the EERE Exchange system. Please note that for this FOA, however, there are no pre-application documents, such as concept papers or letters of intent. We're going to go straight to a full application. Nor will you be able to reply to reviewer comments, as reviewer comments will not be provided to applicants until after selections have been made. So please disregard those sections of the EERE Exchange user guide. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Key submission points. Check all your entries in the EERE Exchange. Submissions could be deemed ineligible due to an incorrect entry. DOE also strongly encourages applicants to submit applications a day or two prior to the deadline, and allow for a full upload of the application document. And this avoids any potential technical glitches with the EERE Exchange system or your internet access. Make sure you push the "Submit" button. I know that sounds sort of silly, but once you have uploaded it, if you make any changes after that, it will unsubmit, and you will need to resubmit. So again, just verify that you've pushed the "Submit" button when you're completed. And for your records, we recommend you print out the EERE Exchange confirmation page at each step, which contains the applicant's – application's control number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Applicants that experience issues with submission prior to the FOA deadline should contact the Exchange help desk or systems. And this is the EERE – <a href="mailto:EERE-exchangesupport@headquarters">EERE-exchangesupport@headquarters</a> – HQ.DOE.gov. The Exchange help desk and or EERE Exchange system administrators will be able to help applicants in resolving issues. The Office of Indian Energy is not able to assist with technical issues associated with the EERE Exchange system, or the submittal of an application. So applicants that experience issues with submissions that result in late submissions should also contact the Exchange help desk. The Exchange help desk and/or EERE Exchange system administrator may be able to assist. I would also strongly encourage you to keep records and/or any documentation, including screenshots, of any issues you experience in submitting your application, and any effort you make to resolve those issues. Next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Applications must designate your primary backup points of contact in the EERE Exchange, and these are folks who DOE will communicate with during the process. Remember, these are the contacts that will be used to notify applicants of whether the application was deemed non-responsive, non-compliant, unsuccessful, or selected for negotiation of an award. It is imperative that the applicant be responsive during the award negotiation so that we can meet our deadline. Next slide, please. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So questions. Questions about this FOA. As we've discussed, all questions need to be in writing and submitted to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. All responses to those questions will be posted in the EERE Exchange website – again, see the Frequently Asked Questions or FAQs page. DOE will attempt to respond to questions within three business days, unless a similar Q&amp;A has already been posted. And we will notify you when a response to your question has been posted. We'll notify you via e-mail. Before submitting a question though, I'd urge you to check the FAQ page to see if your question has already been answered. Next.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So problems logging into EERE Exchange or uploading and submitting application documents. As we've said before, contact the EERE Exchange support at the web – the URL shown there, and include the FOA name and number in the subject line. As questions are not being entertained during this webinar, again please send those to use via e-mail to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>, and again, include the FOA number, name in the subject line. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So best practices. I'd recommend you download the Funding Opportunity Announcement, read it thoroughly so you understand all the steps and requirements for submitting an application, and do not rely solely on this webinar. And if you're considering submitting an application, please register in EERE Exchange as soon as possible, and obtain the control number. As indicated, the control number must be included on all application documents. And also, to check the Frequently Asked Questions webpage periodically for any supplemental information or amendments to the FOA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For any of your interested in only community-scale projects or Topic Area Two, you may not be interested in staying for the remaining slides on energy savings calculation, as these only apply to applications submitted under Topic Area One. For those of you who may be leaving us now, I'd like to take a moment with a few final comments. Hopefully, we've answered some of your questions and provided an overview of the FOA and the process. However, again, if you have any questions, please send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. Please do not ask me or any other Office of Indian Energy staff, or contractor, or laboratory personnel about the eligibility of your project, or any other question related to this FOA, as only formal responses posted under the FAQ webpage on the EERE Exchange website will be honored. The purpose of accepting only written questions is that typically if you have a question, somebody else has that same question. And also this ensures that everyone has the benefit of the same information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remember, registering in Grants.gov means you're receive e-mail notices of any amendments to this FOA, including if there are any extensions to the deadline. But applications will not be accepted through Grants.gov. I'd also like to invite you to join the Office of Indian Energy's e-mail list, and to join you need to see the lower right corner of our website main page at <a href="http://www.Energy.gov">www.Energy.gov</a>\Indianenergy. By subscribing, you'll receive any information on this funding opportunity, funding opportunity through other agencies, training opportunities, webinars, and upcoming events. For information on previously funded tribal energy projects, you can see projects on the website. For a list of other open funding opportunities, see Funding. The Office of Indian Energy also offers free technical assistance. If interested, please check out the technical assistance section of the website and submit a request.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These slides and the audio recording of this webinar will be posted in the next week or so. And as a registrant of the webinar, you will receive an e-mail when the material is available. Note that if there are any inconsistencies between the Funding Opportunity Announcement, this presentation, or statements from DOE personnel, the FOA document is the controlling document and applicants should rely on that FOA language, and if not, seek clarification by sending questions to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. Hopefully, we've answered some of your questions and provided an overview of the FOA in the process. Again, we look forward to seeing your project ideas as part of your application, and possibly working with you in the future. Have a wonderful afternoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And for those of you who are interested in the facility-scale projects under Topic Area One, please stand by and – for more on calculating energy savings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you, Lizana. And everyone who attended this webinar today –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy? Hang on. We're going to go on and go through the energy savings calculation slides.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, great. Sorry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks. So for those interested in Topic Area One, you'll need to complete an energy savings calculation. Under Topic Area One, which is the energy efficiency measures and clean energy systems on tribal buildings, there are specific requirements for reducing the total of all energy and fuel sources used. Specifically, under Topic Area 1A, which is the deep energy retrofits, a 15 percent reduction is required. And under the energy efficiency measures and clean energy system, Topic Area 1B, a 20 percent reduction is required. The percentage of energy saved will be independently verified. Therefore, the methodology described in Appendix C of the FOA must be used. Appendix C includes instructions on how to calculate this energy saved, and the conversion factors that again must be used, and various examples. A Microsoft Excel template has been provided in EERE Exchange for calculating the amount of energy saved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will not describe the methodology documented in Appendix C of the FOA and demonstrate how to use of the energy savings template provided to help you calculate that savings. Remember, these calculations are only required for Topic Area One, not Topic Area Two, which is the community-scale energy development. Next slide, please. First, we're going to discuss the methodology, which is also in Appendix C of the FOA. Note again that these calculations are only required for Topic Area One, not Topic Area Two. No calculations are required for Topic Area Two. So per Appendix C, energy savings is the difference between the total energy usage before the project, and the projected energy usage after the project. The equation for calculating that percentage energy savings is shown here. So to simplify the analysis and to provide an equivalent basis of comparison, all applicants must use a common set of conversion factors. See Table One, which is on the next slide. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So shown here – and as Table One in Appendix C of the FOA – are the conversion factors that must be used in your calculation. The common conversion factors site to source multipliers not only convert energy values to a common unit, which is a kBtu, but also account for the effects of inefficiencies in energy conversion and distribution by converting site energy to source energy. The source energy is being used as it is the most equitable unit of evaluation, and enables assessment of energy efficiency. Source energy traces the heat and electricity requirements of the building back to the raw fuel input, thereby accounting for any losses and enabling a complete thermodynamic assessment. For more, see the Energy Protection Agency – EPA Energy Star website or portfolio manager technical reference on source energy. Note that these conversion factors are already built into the energy savings template, thereby simplifying the calculations for you. And that template again is on the EERE Exchange for download. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the methodologies to be used in calculating energy savings is as follows. First, identify all energy and fuel sources used in each effective building, establish a baseline of the energy currently used in the building or buildings, referred to as the energy usage before project, determine the projected energy usage of the building or buildings after the proposed project is completed, referred to as the projected energy usage after project in Equation One, convert energy values to a common unit of 1000 British thermal units – kBtu – using the unit conversion multipliers provided in Table One. Again, note that the template does these conversions for you. Sum the energy usage values together for the before project case, and sum of the energy usage values together for the after project case. And then calculate the project percentage of energy savings using Equation One.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that the required percentages are different for each subtopic area. It is 15 percent for Topic Area 1A, which is the deep energy retrofit, and it is 20 percent for Topic Area 1B, which includes not only energy efficiency measures, but also clean energy systems. Next. So Appendix C of the FOA contains three step-by-step examples which address a variety of situations. Note that all the examples in Appendix C refer to 2015 as the baseline year, whereas for your applications, the 12 months of data will be the most recent consecutive 12 months of data you have. You will go – we will go over Example One here, which is also exemplified on the energy savings template. So if you're following along on the FOA document, Example One starts on Page 86.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the first example is for Topic Area 1A, clean energy systems, example – oh, I'm so sorry. Example One is actually for Topic Area 1A, which is the deep energy retrofits. And so this example will demonstrate how to calculate the reduction in the total of all energy sources, if energy efficiency measures are implemented. So the proposed project for this example is a 20,000 square foot building – is projected to save 20 percent of its electricity usage, which is 68,000 kilowatt hours, by replacing old inefficient light bulbs with light-emitting diodes or LED light bulbs, and reducing 40 percent of its natural gas usage, or 2,560 therms after implementing a number of energy efficiency measures. The total annual energy usage for the building in 2015 was 340,000 kilowatt hours per year of electricity, 6,400 therms of natural gas, and 15,000 gallons of fuel oil Number Five. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So for this example, we will follow the general steps. Identify all the sources of energy and fuels that are used in the building or buildings. Establish the baseline energy usage before the proposed project is implemented. Determine the projected energy usage after the project, which is the energy usage projected after the project in Equation One. Next slide, please. So remember, the proposed project is estimated to save 20 percent of its electricity usage, or 38.000 kilowatt hours – as you see here, 20 percent savings in electricity in the table. It's also reduced to 40 percent of its natural gas usage, which is the 2,560 therms. And as the calculation needs to account for all energy and fuel sources combined, the 15,000 gallons of fuel oil Number Five needs also to be included in the calculation, even though the proposed project does not impact that particular fuel source. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So as indicated under Step Four, we are only converting the before and after energy and fuel sources to kBtu using the conversion factors in Table One of Appendix C, as shown here, in the table. So Step Five then is to sum all energy and fuel sources combined, whether affected by the proposed project or not, and that equates to the energy usage before project, and the energy usage projected after project. In this example, the energy usage before project is 6,582,500 kBtus, and the energy usage projected after project is 5,586,100 kBtus. Next slide, please. So using the energy usage before project of 6,582,500 kBtus, and the energy usage projected after project of 5,586,100 kBtus, the energy savings is calculated at 15.1 percent. Now this meets the Topic Area 1A requirement of 15 percent minimum. If, however, this example was four Topic Area 1B, then it would not have met the minimum energy savings requirement, since Topic Area 1B has a 20 percent requirement. Next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now we're going to provide an overview of the template and move on to a live overview of the energy savings template file itself. Prior to doing that, we'll be looking at each of the tabs of the template. The tabs are located at the bottom of the Microsoft Excel template, and clicking on each of these tabs will take you to information contained on the tabs themselves. Note that only cells where data input is required can be altered. All other cells on each of these tabs are locked. As shown on this slide, there's a screen image of Tab One, which is labeled as Appendix C Instructions. This tab provides an overview of the information contained in Appendix C, and is summarized here for reference. As shown, this tab provides the equation for energy use savings, the methodology for calculating the energy savings for each of your proposed projects, a fuel conversion factors – pardon me, of various fuels, and assumptions used. Conversion factors are embedded in the template and will be calculated automatically based on the information you provide, and we'll see this during the live demonstration in just a moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The instruction tab also provides color codes to help you complete the workshop – the worksheet, sorry. [laughs] Please note that the red boxes are where data input is required. And I apologize – the images shown on this and the subsequent slides are provided for reference only, and may not be very readable, but we'll go over each of the file tabs individually live, and hopefully that will make it clearer. Next slide, please. So shown here is a screen image of the second tab, which is labeled Example 1A, Form Input. This tab shows you the inputs for the example we just went over, and provides specific instructions on how and what data to enter in the Form Input tab. The Form Input tab provides instructions relative to six general areas as follows – the FOA being applied for, the buildings and type of energy and fuel used, building energy sources, monthly energy or fuel use information, current energy usage – which per the equation is energy usage before project, and finally, project description and energy savings – which per the equation, is the energy usage projected after the project. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So shown here is the screen image of the third tab, labeled Example 1A, Energy Savings. This tab reflects the results of the input from the previous tab where the building energy and fuel use and projected-related data was entered. As shown, this tab not only provides a summary of the information provided from Tab Two, but it also calculates the energy savings and provides you the feedback of energy use and savings, equipment capacities, as well as feedback on whether the project meets the energy savings requirements  specific for each topic area – again, 15 percent for Topic Area 1A, and 20 percent for Topic 1B. As we showed previously in the example, this one calculates out to be 15.1 percent, and since it's being submitted under Topic Area 1A, it meets that requirement, which is also shown in the green box – oh, that's in the middle of the screenshot. There you go. Thank you, Chris. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the fourth tab shown here is the screenshot of Tab Four, which is labeled Form Inputs. And this form is to be used for actually inputting facility and project-related information for your specific project. Note that this is basically blank of Tab Two. This is the only tab that you will need to actually input data. The other four tabs are instructions, examples, and results, and don't require any data input. Next slide, please. So shown here is a screen image of Tab Five, labeled Energy Savings Results. As shown for our example on Tab Two, this tab provides a summary of the information provided in the Form Input tab where you entered data, and will provide you with feedback on your project's energy use, the projected energy savings, as well as whether your project meets the requirements of the FOA – the energy savings requirements of the FOA. No input is required on this tab – all cells are locked. Note that the results from this template is provided for the applicant's benefit. All energy savings will actually be independently verified.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now let's move on to the next slide. So just give us a moment to transfer the computer Excel file so we can show you the actual tabs. So this is the first tab, which is the Appendix C instructions. As you can see, that first part shows you the color codes that we've used. The bright yellow is instructional. The orange box is the new section. The red box, as I indicated before, is where data entry is required. The gray box indicates information that was populated or calculated field. White boxes contain important information – we'll go through that. And pale yellow boxes provide notes and instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So going down a little further, these are the steps that we went through – Step One, which is identifying all your fuel sources, establishing a baseline. And then we go on to the equation. Step Three is determining the projected energy usage after the project, as we discussed. Step Four is to convert the energy values to common kBtus using the conversion factors. And then we have the table of the conversion factors. Then the next step would be to sum your values for the before and for the after case, and to calculate the projected percentages. Then we go on to some general notes and guidance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So going on to the second tab, this is the example that we've gone over. The first one is to designate the topic area under the FOA – that would be Rows Five and Six. The next section is to identify the building and types of energy used. So as you can see on Row 14, for this office building, which is 20,000 square feet, as we discussed, it's going to use electricity, natural gas – maybe we can scroll over just a smidge – and it goes into the different types of energy and fuel sources. Each of those cells are basically dropdown boxes – yes or no, whether you use it. Let's go back and go down. As we indicated, the pale yellow boxes give you instructions on what will go in those sections. So you can refer to that as your filling out data. The third one is to enter the type of energy fuel use for each building, and identify whether there are attached utility bills or fuel invoices. So here we have a row for each energy or fuel type used, and that shows the monthly values. Scroll over, and it indicates that we do have utility data evidence of those cost and usage for each of those types of energy and fuel sources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this basically includes the energy and fuel use information by month. So if we'll scroll over, there is goes from January to December. And this calculates by type – the reduction. And those that will be reduced. And if you recall, the fuel oil Number Five is not impacted by the proposed project. So we have a brief project description, which you would input basically from the example. It's just reiterated here. We talk about the details of the proposed project, the types of systems that you're proposing, and keep scrolling down – and it will show the energy use that's projected after the project. So going on to Example 1A energy savings, we have the project description – that's basically carried over again on this tab. All of the cells are locked. There's no data input. But it does summarize the information you included on the previous tab. Going down – if you can just scroll just a little bit – again, so you see that the energy before project – the 6,582,500 kBtus, and after the project, it's projected to be 5,586,100 kBtus, or 15.1 percent reduction. And it indicates that the energy savings are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And on the other side, if we scroll a little bit more to the right, this section would be to calculate a system capacity for clean energy systems, which in this case for Topic Area 1A is not applicable. So going on to the next tab, which is the Form Input, this is identical to the example. It just doesn't have any of the data, but you see the dropdown boxes there. You can pick Topic Area 1A, Topic Area 1B, If you go down to the next one, you would need to type in building name, square footage, but then you would use dropdown boxes to say yes or no – whether in this case the electricity was being reduced or not, or used in that building, actually. So again – and then the final tab – the final tab, again, is just identical to the energy savings Example 1A that we just went over. And it will populate with the information you input, and calculate the energy use before the project in kBtus and the energy use after the project, and the percent energy savings, and indicate, depending on the topic area, whether you meet that requirement of 50 percent or 20 percent, respectively, and the minimum thresholds for the Topic Area 1B, which is 10 kilowatts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's all I have on the energy savings. We have some final comments here. And we're just about on time, huh? What a miracle. [laughs] So well, hopefully we've provided some information and answered some of your questions. I do have a few final reminders. Submit your questions to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. Don't forget to register in all the various systems. First and foremost, register with FedConnect to obtain a control number, which is – or register on EERE Exchange to obtain a control number, which is required on all your application documents. Each application submitted by an Indian tribe must have a tribal council resolution, or something comparable, so plan early. Use the table on Pages 25 and 26 of the FOA document as a checklist to ensure you've uploaded the complete application. And get your application in early. You can always revise or update the files up until the application deadline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And again, thank you so much for your attention. Have a wonderful afternoon, and I'll pass it back to you, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks. Lizana. And thanks everyone for attending the webinar today. And remember, you'll be notified when the audio recording and PowerPoints are available, which is expected in about one to two weeks. And we hope this webinar has been useful. Any questions regarding Funding Opportunity Announcement can be sent to <a href="mailto:Tribal@EE.DOE.gov">Tribal@EE.DOE.gov</a>. And thanks again for attending. This concludes today's webinar. Goodbye.</p>
