<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Good morning or good afternoon wherever you may be, and welcome to the 10th webinar of the 2016 DOE Tribal Renewable Energy webinar series on Accessing Capital for Tribal Energy and Economic Development. I'm Randy Manion, today's webinar chair and manager of Western Area Power Administration's Renewable Resource program. We're gonna just go over a few housekeeping items before we get started.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    Today's webinar is being recorded and will be made available on DOE's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs website, along with copies of today's PowerPoint presentations in about one week. Everyone will receive a post-webinar e-mail with a link to the page where the slides and recording will be located. Because we are recording this webinar, all phones have been muted for this purpose. We'll answer all your questions at the end of all the presentations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, you can submit a question at any time by clicking on the question button located in the webinar control panel on your screen, then typing your question in. And if you've entered your audio PIN when you joined, at the end of the webinar, you can raise your hand by clicking on the Raise Your Hand icon, and I'll unmute you so you can ask our panel your question directly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And we'll try to keep the webinar to no more than 90 minutes, but there's always a possibility we could get pushed out to 2 hours. So with that, we have several speakers today, and we're gonna start with opening remarks from Lizana Pierce. Lizana is a program manager in the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, duty-stationed and Golden, Colorado.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana's responsible for implementing national funding and financing programs and administering the resultant Tribal Energy Project grants and agreements. She has more than 20 years of clean energy technology, project development, and management experience assisting tribes in developing their energy resources and building their energy visions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She holds a bachelor's of science degree in mechanical engineering from Colorado State University and pursued a master's in business administration through the University of Northern Colorado. Lizana, it's a pleasure to have you back and give opening remarks, and the virtual floor is now yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Thank you, Randy. And hello, everyone. I join Randy in welcoming you to the 10th webinar of the 2016 series. This webinar series is sponsored by two U.S. Department of Energy organizations, the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs and Western Area Power Administration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    This series is designed to provide information on economic development and appointment options using renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. The Office of Indian Energy assists tribes with energy solutions related to energy development, capacity building, energy infrastructure, stabilizing energy costs, and electrifying Indian lands and homes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    To provide this assistance, we work within the Department of Energy across government agencies and with Indian tribes and organizations to promote Indian energy policies and initiatives and to help Indian tribes overcome barriers in meeting their energy goals. To help tribes overcome those barriers, the Office of Indian Energy has developed various programs, initiatives, and partnerships of which this webinar series is an example.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    As you know, there's a tremendous amount of energy resources on Indian lands, and they represent opportunities for tribes to exert energy sovereignty, enable economic development, and to create jobs. And at this point, many tribes are exploring and developing their clean energy resources. And to hear their stories, I would like to invite you to join us at our annual program review. This gathering is being held November 14th through the 17th in Denver, Colorado. To learn more, please see more information on the Office of Indian Energy website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    So during this webinar, we will focus on accessing capital for tribal energy and economic development. Our hope is that attendees will learn about details of financing renewable energy projects, use of federal or state incentives, local resources and partnerships to develop creative project financing terms and structures, using the database for state incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency, which is a terrific resources, and new market tax credits and how they work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have one more webinar remaining in the 2016 webinar series, and each of these 2016 webinars have tried to provide information, case studies, and resources. If you've missed past webinars, you can see those on DOE's Office of Indian Energy website, and we appreciate your attention and interest, and we welcome your feedback, and thank you for joining us. With that, I'm gonna turn the virtual floor back over to Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thanks, Lizana. Yeah, and we have three additional speakers today, Paul Schwabe, Joel, Laubenstein, and Brian Lipscomb. And I'll provide a brief intro about each of them now, and then, we'll get started.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    Paul Schwabe is a section supervisor and senior financing analyst at NREL. Since 2008, Paul has provided comprehensive solar technology and business model assistance to tribal municipal and electric cooperatives throughout the U.S. He currently manages a team of eight market financing, and Paul's the analyst within NREL's strategic analysis center.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    And Joel Laubenstein is a principal at Baker Tilly International and a member of their energy and utilities team. He specializes in the management of energy and infrastructure initiatives working with tribal governments, agribusiness, and food and beverage. Prior to joining Baker Tilly, Joel served as a project manager for a privately held renewable energy project developer, where he was responsible for technology, transfer, site selection, contract negotiation, and capital structuring and acquisition. He has a bachelor of science degree from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    And Brian Lipscomb is an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and has spent his career, over 30 years, managing resources across the Northwest. Since 2012, he has been the CEO for Energy Keepers, Inc., a corporation of Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, established to acquire and operate the damn and power plant they've acquired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    The facility generates about 1.1 million megawatt-hours of electricity on an annual average basis, which is primarily sold into the wholesale market of the Northwest. His breadth and experience includes time with the U.S. Forest Service, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and as the executive director of the Columbian Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority. Brian has a degree in civil engineering from Montana State University.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    So with that, we'll get started with Paul. And Paul, just give me a moment to get your slide deck pulled up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            Sounds great. Thank you, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay, Paul. It's all yours</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            All right. Well, thank you, Randy, and thanks to DOE and to WAPA for hosting us for this presentation. As Randy mentioned, I'm Paul Schwabe, and I'm a financing analyst here at NREL. I've done a number of tribal-related finance projects over the past few years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And today, I'm just gonna be talking about a small subset of that. The title is "Tax Incentive-Based Financing" or "Tax Equity Financing Structures," which I think is, perhaps, a non-obvious but pretty economically valuable type of financing option that tribes can consider in a number of different ways, which we'll talk about. So next slide please, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So when we talk about financing, there are really a variety of different options, sources of capital, that make up what's called, essentially the "project stack," the "financing stack," of all the different types of different sources of capital that can be used towards a renewable energy project. Probably from order of most easily accessible but perhaps the least-desirable-to-use structuring, down towards kind of more complexity but perhaps develop less experienced in developing is the ordering here of different financing structures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're primarily gonna focus what's on the bottom in red on the tax incentive-based financing. But I thought I would spend a minute or so on this slide just to kinda give an overview of the different structures and really just to emphasize the point that most renewable energy projects combine a number of these different types of sources of capital or revenue streams. So just because we're focusing on one form of it does not mean that any less of these are less viable or options to consider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the ones we see quite a bit in terms of tribes is particularly in – the top two are either grants or kind of self-equity or cash from tribal entities. Often, these are used in conjunction with one another. And so basically, cash is from any number of operating activities that a tribe may currently pursue. And it's often combined with grant from federal agencies, such as DOE or USDA or a number of different other programs, typically with some sort of match component that is often competitively based and solicited on various points throughout the year or every other year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Renewable energy incentives – many renewable energy projects are also eligible for types of either state-based or utility-based incentive programs. So depending on a tribe's utility situation, they may be eligible for types of state-based incentives or utility-based incentives, where essentially, if the utility to encourage various forms of renewable energy, if the utility is a beneficiary to that renewable energy, they'll often offer some sort of either buy-down or incentive over the – for generation. So that's one thing that we won't spend a lot of time, but we can answer questions about at the end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monetizing the green attributes is another kind of form of sourcing capital, in the capital stack. This is essentially the right to claim the green attributes of renewable energy projects, so the right to claim that you're using renewable energy is a separate value stream in many cases, depending on the market you're in, from the actual energy itself and can be used or essentially sold off separately from the project to bring in additional capital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing I wanted to talk about is tribes are positioned to be able to either be borrowers to tax-exempt debts or issue tax-exempt debt themselves. There are certainly a number of restrictions tribes face when doing so, but it is a pretty common option to finance various forms of infrastructure projects. We've also seen tribal corporate debt, so that's – would be through a tribal subsidiary that is able to issue debt, either tax-exempt or taxable debt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, finally, the last two, new market tax credits, which Joel is gonna be spending time on, so I won't spend much time. And then, finally, the main thing of this focus, of this presentation, is tax incentive-based financing mechanisms. So next slide, please. Randy, if you wouldn't mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this, I tried to just kind of highlight what the concept – tax base and financing incentives is sort of cumbersome. But really, the idea is to be using non-competitively sourced federal tax incentives to secure both tribal and private capital to support renewable energy development. When I'm saying tax-based financing incentives, I'm really talking about one of two credits, which are shown in red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first is either the investment tax credit, which I'll spend a little time, or the production tax credit, which I'll also explain. And then, that's coupled with depreciation benefits, which is available to all forms of renewable energy development just as it is of other source of capital investments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So if you woke up this morning excited to hear about depreciation discussion, this is the presentation for you. We'll get to that in a minute, but the idea here is really that – and why I have underlined non-competitive is the federal government has incentivized renewable energy development through the tax code. It presents a challenge for tribal entities to take advantage of these types of incentives, but it is not insurmountable. There are certainly financing mechanisms that can do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the point of non-competitiveness is that if the tribe develops the projects under the right qualifications and mechanisms, it's not a competitively sourced incentive mechanism. It's not a grant where you're competing with other project applicants. If the project is developed in a certain way, it's a new project, and it falls within the period of eligibility, it will be awarded that tax incentive and depreciation. Next slide, please, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay. And so this is sort of the "why," why I go through this challenging exercise of understanding how tribes can benefit from a tax-based incentive. And really try to – pinning it down to a number is – we like to say kind of a rule-of-thumb estimate is somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of either the cost of a renewable energy system, or the value that that system can bring is recovered through tax-based incentives. And this is the tax credits I'll talk about and combine with the depreciation benefit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is such a large economic driver of projects that it often can – it can attract investment from third-party capital providers who might provide a portion or all of the projects' financing costs in exchange for those tax incentives. And typically, because these are structured to be allocated over a period of time, the investor does not necessarily have to be in the project for the entire period. So if the tribe's goal is to eventually have ownership of a project or be kind of the sole proprietor of the project, there are contractually ways to do so as soon as in year five or six or potentially up to around year ten of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it's also, as I mentioned before, this structure is certainly possible to tax incentives to combine with other forms of capitals, including new market tax credits, including other incentives from state or utility programs, grant programs. There's nuances and considerations for doing so, but in order to get that economically valuable incentive and get the entire project funded, oftentimes, requires combining multiple sources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And certainly, one point I'd like to make is tribes don't have to – tribal entities have to pursue these incentive structures, but if they are choosing not to do so, then it is leaving a considerable financial incentive on the table. And so it's up to the tribe's discretion if the kind of amount of work necessary and cost to incur to secure these tax incentives is worth the financial benefit. So next slide, please, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the next three slides, we'll just go over the different nuances between the three types of incentives I mentioned. The first is known as the "investment tax credit," or ITC for short is how it's typically referred to. And this is primarily an incentive for solar energy technologies, although geothermal is also eligible – geothermal electric, I should say, not heat pumps – geothermal electric for reduced value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For solar, this is worth approximately 30 percent of the project's cost. So essentially, the federal government has offered a tax incentive for 30 percent of the eligible cost of a renewable energy system. This structure or incentive was recently, at the end of 2015, reauthorized for a number of additional years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the table below shows the schedule from now through 2022. What you'll see is solar technologies are eligible for 30 percent tax credit through end of the year 2019. And then, beginning in 2020 and 2021, it transitions down from the current 30 percent to 10 percent of value beginning in year 2022.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the example above is just really to quickly to kind of understand how we got to that 40 to 50 percent value that I talked about earlier is if you had a 1-megawatt solar project, which is a mid-scale size tribal project, roughly around $2 million at current prices. But this ITC would be worth approximately $600,000.00 recovered in the first year of the project through a tax incentive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing I should note is not 100 percent of a project costs are actually eligible. Certain things won't be eligible for this cost, but the rule of thumb is something like 90 to 95 percent of costs are typically eligible for the ITC. For purposes of simplicity, we ignored that for the example and below, but most of the project's costs are eligible for that ITC, the investment tax credit, and then, in this case, about $600,000.00 of the $2 million project costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next slide, please, Randy. Oh, back one. I think you went to – perfect. Thank you very much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the other one that is quite a prominent tax credit is the production tax credit or PTC. And this one differs in its structure from the ITC, which was just discussed previously. The production tax credit is a tax credit based on every kilowatt-hour produced by a renewable energy system. For wind and geothermal electric technologies, it's worth 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. And for other technologies, such as landfill gas, certain municipal solid waste projects, it's about half that project, so 1.2 cents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And both of these tax credits are available for ten years after the project is built. So if you can imagine a wind project that was installed, built, producing electricity, every kilowatt-hour that was produced for the first ten years of the project's life is receiving a federal tax credit in 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This has a different expiration or eligibility period than the ITC. Currently, it's 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour through the end of the fiscal year or – excuse me – calendar year – December 31, 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you'll see in the table beginning in 2017 is that this tax credit is being phased out in the next 3 years. So 80 percent value in 2017, 60 percent value in 2018, and 40 percent value in 2019 and expired thereafter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What's really important, I think, to note on this is developers can qualify by starting construction. So it used to be that you had to have the project totally finished in order to receive this tax credit. Now, basically what happens is if you begin construction and meet certain construction milestones, you basically get to reserve the tax credit that is in place when you officially were recognized as starting construction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So as an example, if, say like you're in a situation where a project hasn't started at all at the current point, but next year, 2017, you began construction, met certain qualifications from the IRS, the project would get that 80 percent value, even if it wasn't fully finished in 2017. It kind of puts a placeholder on that tax credit amount and allows you to qualify for that amount.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this example, we have a 1-megawatt wind project that is a little bit of a cheaper upfront cost. The solar project here about $1.5 million at current prices would receive about $70,000.00 annually per year for a period of 10 years or $700,000.00 over the entire 10-year period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike the ITC where it was received in a lump-sum payment, this tax credit is earned over time and essentially the project for every kilowatt-hour that it generates over the years earning that kilowatt-hour. If for some reason the projects – or that tax credit – if for some reason the project is no longer earning revenue or producing kilowatt hours, then it's – would be no longer earning that tax credit for the first ten years of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And Lizana did make a point to talk about the database for state incentives for renewable incentives. These are complicated rules for eligibility and starting construction and different values. I recommend the links at the bottom are links directly to the DSIRE database or that database for state incentives for renewable energy, has the most up to date and current information. So I encourage you to look at those links for the most current and up-to-date information. But generally, this only changes with kind of legislative changes as laws are passed over time. Next slide, please, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this one is probably the most conceptually difficult to grasp, but I would say most common form of tax-based incentives is accelerated appreciation. And this is basically allowing project developers or owners of renewable energy projects to depreciate certain costs of the renewable energy system. And for renewable energy projects, that cost schedule is accelerated, so it's over a period of five years, even though the project itself might have a lifetime of 15 to 25 years, something in that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's a reduction in the taxable income of a project, so whereas the tax credits were a reduction in the tax liability, meaning whatever the end result the tax bill was, the accelerated depreciation is an incentive on the taxable income – essentially the amount of income that you're paying taxes on. The really important thing to note here is that the makers, as it's pronounced, is in addition to the ITC or PTC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I failed to mention but should mention, the ITC and the PTC, you get one or the other but not both. So depending on the technology, you may get the ITC, or you may get the PTC, but you won't get both. However, in either case, you can combine whatever tax credit was elected with the accelerated depreciation. And the nice thing about it is there's no stated expiration date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And depreciation really is just a benefit that is used like any other type of infrastructure investment, things like any sort of equipment – office equipment, industrial equipment – computers. All that equipment is depreciated, and in that sense, renewable energy is treated the same as any other sort of infrastructure or equipment investment. In this case, we return to our solar project example of the 1-megawatt project that cost around $2 million, that this accelerated depreciation will recover about $550,000.00 in the first 6 years of the profit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The schedule below shows what percentage of the project's cost can be recovered in which year. You'll see it's basically – even though it's considered a five-year depreciation, the actual schedule is over six years. And each percentage is according to the table there. Next slide, please, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the next slide will be just a couple diagrams of how and why a tribe or a tribal entity might consider a tax incentive-based financing structure. So one of the main – or a common way to finance renewable energy project is through public funding sources, such as a grant mechanism or other incentive mechanism. In this structure, a tribal government or the tribe itself, typically which is structured as a non-taxable entity, pursues capital sources, such as a public funding source, a grant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They develop an energy project. That energy project essentially produces one revenue stream really, which is the energy, and then, that energy is either used, which is the red line by the tribal entity, or it's sold to a related party in the transaction that would like to purchase the energy of the project. If you could hit the Advance button one time, Randy – perfect. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the other option is this a little bit more complicated structure, admittedly, but does offer benefits of doing so. So this is the tax-equity structure, and this is where essentially a tribal corporation or a taxable entity enters into an agreement with a third-party investor in the project, as shown by the first arrow with private funding. That investor typically contributes project to the capital – or project capital to the project. They form an independent – typically a LLC, a limited liability corporation, who develops a project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And what I'd say is the primary difference is is now that there are essentially two revenue streams, the energy component, which may be handled by the tribal corp. or the taxable entity. And then, the secondary revenue source is the tax credits and depreciation. And typically, that flows through to the private investor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in exchange for their capital upfront, they receive the tax credits and depreciation of the project. So it does add a bit of complexity. There's quite a bit financial structuring involved. In reality, these diagrams get much more complicated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The analogy I use is sometimes it looks like a bowl of spaghetti to track everything, but because it is such an economically large incentive – 40 to 50 percent of the project's value or cost, it makes sense to investigate these types of financing options. Next slide, Randy. And I think you just have two more slides, and then, I'll turn it over to Joel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So there are a lot of different ways in which a tribe can both directly or indirectly benefit from these tax incentives. Probably the most common structure we've seen from the municipal world but also applicable to tribal world is where the tribe agrees through a contracting arrangement called a PPA or a power purchase agreement. And in this role, the tribe essentially hosts the renewable energy system, and they partner with a external partner who develops the project, and they receive the tax benefits. That is the credits and the incentives, and that's worth, usually, somewhere around 40 to 50 percent of the projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tribe is still generally purchasing electricity from their local electricity provider, but the tribe itself can benefit from those incentives because they're purchasing renewable electricity at a rate lower than what it would've been had the tax credits not been available. So oftentimes, we see tribes or government entities or corporate entities not really wanting to pay any sort of premium for renewable energy. So in order to do so, you have to make sure that the incentives are being utilized and by partnering with a financial in the project, they can sell renewable electricity to the tribe more cheaply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are other structures that tribes can look into, such as a land host or a service provider, which provides sort of indirect benefits, or I would say supplemental benefits to the tribe. But the tribe itself may not be receiving the benefits of the tax incentives or through kind of the structuring of a tribal corporation to be an actual partner in the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I wanna be a little balanced on this. Next slide, please, Randy. There is no question that the use of tax incentives does present some additional challenges, but that they're not surmountable. Probably the most obvious one is, in order to use the tax credit efficiently, an entity must, themselves have a tax liability. This can create challenges for tribal entities unless they have a for-profit tribal subsidiary that can use the tax credits themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So typically, a tribe or a tribal entity would need to find a partner in the project who would essentially invest capital in the project for those tax incentives. Because that is usually the route that we see tribes and municipalities exploring, there can be quite a bit of structuring costs and transaction costs, particularly as a tribe develops a first or a second of a kind project in this regard. Once there are sort of other experiences to draw from of these tax incentives, there is some efficiencies where you don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of these transaction costs and just the structuring time, there is sort of a minimum threshold of project size or cost that needs to be large enough to absorb that. And there is no set number of what that threshold is, but, generally, somewhere in the couple million-dollar range in order for the project to be large enough to both attract investment but also be able to incorporate those transaction costs of utilizing the tax incentives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that is my last slide. I guess, just in summary, that we have seen a tremendous amount of renewable energy development, both nationally in the U.S., largely driven by much of these tax incentive-based policies. It is – can be challenging to do so but can provide a compelling economic benefit for doing so. I think, as I mentioned, it can be combined with other sources of financing options, such as new market tax credits, and I think that's where Joel will be discussing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you, Paul. And Joel, I've got your slide deck up, so it's all yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       All right. Terrific. Thank you, Randy. Thank you, Paul, for the good overview and appreciate the opportunity to present today. As was mentioned, just real quickly, I live within Baker Tilly's energy utilities group. Our firm is about 2800 folks, so a much smaller subset that live, eat, and breathe energy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    So my interface with new market tax credits is really as they intersect with energy transactions, and I'll try to bring some of that perspective here to the presentation today. And I sit and lead our Austin, Texas office, which is the newest office we have. So if anyone ever gets to Austin, we'd be happy to host you. It's a great town. Proceed, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    So let's talk about new market tax credits a little bit. We could spend a day going through the program, and it would still be challenging for folks to understand. We've got about 20 minutes, so I'm gonna try to hit the high points here in terms of, "What is the benefit to me as a tribe? Who are these entities called CDEs that have the credits? What makes a solid new markets opportunity?" and overall benefits and then a little bit about what we do in the States. Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    So Overview and Benefits. Next slide. So unlike a lot of the other tax credit programs, most other tax credit programs, these crazy new market tax credits don't belong to you as the project developer. They're awarded to these entities called CDEs or community development entities from the U.S. Department of Treasury. So these credits, once awarded to CDEs, are deployed into eligible projects, monetized by a tax credit investor, and then ultimately loaned to your project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    So that is the mechanism by which – what's in it for me? The funding gets to a project, very unique from other programs, like the ITC, the PCC that was just discusses, and in that this actually is injected into the project by way of a very, very inexpensive loan. So that's the big critical distinction we should come away with from today. It's not a grant, obviously, and it's certainly not an entitlement. It's a competitive program, which I'll talk a little bit about more. But this is injected into your project in the form of an actual loan, and you don't own the credit per se. Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    What everybody is concerned about is, again, what's in it for me. And an important distinction here is an allocation in new market tax credits does not equal cash to the project. So we hear a lot of folks fairly new to the program talk about, "Well, I got $10 million in new market tax credit financing for my $10 million project. I guess I'm done, right?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    Well, it doesn't work that way. $10 million, due to the value of these credits and the way the program is set up, $10 million new market tax credit allocation is worth, in the form of a tax credit, $3.9 million. Distinctly from the ITC, where if you had a $10 million solar project, you would be eligible for – from an entitlement perspective – of a $3 million credit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    Here, it's a little different. The credit's worth 39 cents on the dollar, and it is earned over a period of 7 years. Because that credit is earned over time vs. upfront, the investor, the entity that's going to give you money or give the CDE money to be loaned into the project, is going to discount that. And after you take into consideration discounts and significant transaction costs – no question about it – the net cash to the project, say a $10 million – or any project really – is between 20 and 25 percent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And again, that comes into the project in the form of a very interest-only, low-interest loan for a period of seven years. And I'll talk a little bit about the structure and why it's significantly better than a loan, but it does come into the project as a loan. So on a $10 million development, think of it as 20 – 25 percent of your staff, and I think I articulate that in the next slide, Randy, if you wanna proceed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So yes, again, and in this infographic, think of it simply as if I've got my project, new market tax credits can provide 25 percent of the financing. I've gotta come up with the rest, whether that's any of the sources that were listed on Paul's prior presentation or equity, borrowed funds, other grants, other incentives. Important to note that you can, in fact, twin both the new market tax credit and the ITC or the PTC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So when you talk about the value of ITC depreciation, new market tax credits, you can stack those credits on top of each other. And in fact, in some cases, it's easier to complete a transaction when they are used in conjunction. So when you talk about the value of the PTC, ITC, and new markets, you can get well north of 50 percent of your total project costs funded through these mechanisms if you're willing to go through the process, and, of course, with the new market tax credits, if you can solicit allocation, because it, again, it is not an entitlement. Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So CDEs, you heard this acronym, and there's a lot of other acronyms with this program. But one of the most important one and we're all focused on now is the CDE, the community development entities, those that are awarded credit to allocate to your project. Again, distinction between ITC, where you claim a credit on your tax return and the federal government entitles you to that credit. In this case, the federal government entitles CDEs to be allocated credits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what is a CDE? Who are they? A CDE can be just about anybody, a division of state or local government, a subsidiary of a bank or other financial institutions, a not-for-profit organization, or a privately held firm like Baker Tilly. We have a subsidiary that is a CDE and has won competitively been awarded credits in the past. Like as a firm, we've deployed into projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So it can be all over the board in terms of who is a CDE. There's a process for forming one, and there are a small number of tribally controlled or tribally dedicated CDEs that have been awarded credits over the years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what are these CDEs charged with doing? And what are they looking for? Well, each has a little different mission. Will that be geography? Will it be purpose or goal? For example, CDE X may have the purpose of putting credits into hospitals and inner cities across the U.S. or CDE Y, the state of Wisconsin, for example, may only have a targeted deployment region of the rural state of Wisconsin, as an example.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So it's really all over the board in navigating that in terms of finding the best match of a CDE for a specific project is something we do when we help clients try to source credits. Again, can't reiterate it enough that this is a very competitive credit. It's a limited resource and not an entitlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in this case, the CDE, more or less, has leverage over where they're going to deploy the credits. And they can, in not so many words, call the shots in terms of how a transaction might flow or need to be structured or what requirements you might have as a tribal government or affiliate of a tribal government in terms of having to submit to obtain the dollars. So that's, again, a big distinction that we've gotta understand, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in subsequent slides. So Randy, next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now that we understand, at a very high level, who these guys are that are controlling the credit out there in the finance world, let's talk about what actually makes a solid new market tax credit opportunity. To be clear, although this is a energy-focused webinar, the new market tax credit program was not developed around energy projects per se.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While there have been a number of transactions that have been related to energy and renewable energy, it's really an economic development-based tax credit. So when we talk about qualifications from an energy project perspective, you're really competing with all sorts of other types of project and all sorts of other types of regions across the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the first step in the form of a minimum project qualifications is the project's gotta meet geographic requirements. And this is in as much as the business or your project entity must be in what's classified as a low-income community, which has a very specific definition based on some demographic requirements that I'm gonna talk about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're not within this low-income community, you may have another opportunity to be eligible, and you get into more specific factors – if you have a brownfield, if you're in a certain medical zone, KIP zones, and other ways. But the easiest way to qualify is to be within this low-income community designation. And we've got a mapping tool on our website that there's going to be a reference to at the end of the presentation, where you can very easily go in, type in your address to your project and get an initial first blush, "Am I eligible or not purely based on my geography?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So if we get back and we talk about the hurdle and get beyond that, let's go to the next slide, Randy. And I talk about these criteria. So we're in an eligible census tract. Now, is our census tract what's called "highly distressed"? Because again, because this is competitive, if we're not highly distressed, it's going to be much more difficult to get allocation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So how is "highly distressed" quantified? It's poverty level. It's median income level. It's unemployment rates, and a big factor is, "Is it rural or metropolitan?" If it's rural, you're in a much better position because rural projects are generally underserved by programs, and there's a minimum requirement for allocation to go into rural projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So but the good thing is – I don't know if it's necessarily a good thing, but the reality is a lot of tribal reservations and tribal lands are located in areas that are rural. Oftentimes, there's unemployment issues. Oftentimes, there's median income and poverty issues. So generally speaking, tribal projects, more than other types of projects, tend to be eligible and very good candidates for the program from an eligibility perspective.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other key factors – and this is important as it pertains to energy – is community impact. Again, as I referenced, from a competitive perspective, you're competing against all sorts of projects. So if I'm building a five-megawatt solar project that's only creating two jobs and I'm just selling power back to the grid, there's not a whole lot of economic development associated with that project when I might be competing for the same credits of a medical center that's serving a needy population and creating 200 jobs, for example.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So contrarily, if I'm building a 5-megawatt solar project that I can demonstrate as directly sending power or offsetting power of my reservation and saving me low-income people living on the reservation in terms of power bills, saving them 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent a year, that's a really good story. So framing these types of projects in when it comes to energy projects can be challenging sometimes when you don't have a lot of key job creation, so you've gotta go to other community impact issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, the other key factor of the three key factors is readiness. Again, because this is a competitive credit, this big allocation of credits gets awarded, generally, annually, and then, these CDEs that we talked about are out in the market looking for projects to put credits into. You've gotta be able to demonstrate that you're ready, generally ready to close on a project financing within, let's say, three to six months. And you've also gotta be able to demonstrate that you can make relatively quick decisions through a closing process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So and again, from a readiness perspective, what does that really mean? Well, I've got the other sources of funding. Again, we talk about new markets will bring 25 percent. I've got my other 75 percent at least identified or circled, whatever that funding might be, and generally got most of my permits and other approvals in place to put shovels in the ground fairly soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So those are the three really key issues or profile factors that we look for when we start to talk to tribes about, "Does this make sense to continue down the path, and/or are we just not ready? And do we have to look at the next funding round or the next cycle?" Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So nuts and bolts, what makes a good new market tax project? And you'll note the first four examples there don't have anything to do with energy per se. But those are all types of projects that we see in Indian country that are great candidates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From an energy perspective, infrastructure – and energy infrastructure projects certainly can be really good candidates, but again, you've gotta be able to show that direct benefit to low-income communities because wind and solar, specifically, there's not going to be a lot of direct job creation. Now, if you're talking about maybe a biomass-to-energy project, like a biomass _____ _____ energy project, those are great new market fields because they create a lot of jobs, both directly and indirectly, and we've actively helped fund those types of projects and had a lot of success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you're talking about other options, maybe there's a tribal grocery store being built. It's a $10 million project. You'd really like to include a megawatt of solar as part of that project, but you don't have the funding for it, maybe you've got the $10 million already lined up. If you run the $10 million through a new market tax credit financing structure and are able to obtain allocation, you're gonna raise another $2 million – $2.5 million that'll pay for that solar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So distributed generation projects adjacent to other development projects are always good candidates for this type of program, but it's not a one-size-fits all. We certainly don't want you to come away with any indication from today's presentation that this is going to fit every single type of energy project that you might be looking to develop. Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So again, just to circle back to the program benefits, I think it's become hopefully clear through the first few slides, but it gives you the additional capital to fund projects, maybe to fill a gap. I think the other way, again, to look at it is, "Maybe I should look at doing some distributed generation solar at an asset I'm already building," like a community center, like a medical center, like a feed store, or grocery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And this new markets program will help me pay for that, get lower-cost renewable energy, without me having to deploy any additional capital." So leveraging what you might be already doing through the program to add a renewables piece. Whether it be a distributed generation solar or wind, it is one way to really leverage the program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is low-cost capital. I mentioned it comes in to the project as a loan, but it's almost like a grant because, at the end of the compliance period, which, for this program, is seven years, that interest-only loan – and it's usually two percent or so interest for benchmarking purposes – sits on your project books for seven years. And you pay two percent on that new market tax-credit loan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's say it's a $10 million project. The loan would be $2.5 million – $2 million – $2.5 million – that new market tax-credit benefit we talked about. And then, at the end of that seven-year period, there's a debt forgiveness piece in that the tax investor that is invested to gain the tax credits doesn't wanna keep holding that loan out there. So you, essentially, are given the opportunity to purchase that loan for $1,000.00 via put-call agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now, you owe yourself that $2.5 million note, which is where the debt forgiveness comes into place. And that note can – there are a variety of strategies you can do to deal with that debt forgiveness. But essentially, you owe yourself that money that was borrowed to you, so the loan disappears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So when we say it's free, it's not quite free money, but it's very close to free money, that's what we mean. And for the purposes of today's webinar, I'm not gonna go into a lot more detail on that, but there have been billions and billions of dollars of transaction structured around that type of concept. And that's the way the program works to maximize it to its fullest extent is this concept of not a grant, not a tax equity investment, like Paul discussed with the ITC or PTC tax investor, but a forgivable loan that comes in and sits on the project's books for seven years, is interest-only at a very low rate, and then at the end of seven years essentially disappears. Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So again – go back one. I'm sorry. High-level considerations – again, just to recap, it's not an entitlement. It's a competitive program. There are lender requirements, like other tax equity transactions. The lender has to get along with the tax investor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the tribe is the lender or there's grant funding coming in, it's a lot easier to get all the parties in the transaction to get along. There's some collateral and lien requirements that are different than a traditional loan. As I mentioned, the tax investor earns their credits over a period of seven years, so the lender can't forebear on the actual project for a period of seven years because the tax investor needs to earn their credit to get their return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So there are definitely some intricacies to these transactions. Again, not appropriate to go into a lot of detail on them for the purposes of this webinar, but there's some brain damage involved, as I like to say, no doubt, and in addition to borrower requirements. Next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But with that being said, I get to the bottom line, and we work with all sorts of entities – tribal and nontribal – with this program since its conception, really, in 2000, so 16-plus years. And it always comes back to, "Is it worth going through process and challenges," in other words, brain damage, "if I can fund 20 to 25 percent of my project with almost free, very low-cost capital?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, I always like to say to folks, if you don't need the money, it may not be a program for you. But if you see the benefit in funding 25 percent of your program and it's _____ attract a project, which you can determine very easily upfront without any real cost, it's probably a program worth taking a close look at, especially this year, and I'll talk about that. Randy, next slide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So again, just to kinda conclude current status of the new market tax credit markets. Program was recently extended for five years, so it's not going anywhere. The CDEs that are anticipated to get this allocation that are gonna be looking for your projects, they submitted applications about a year ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This round of funding is very, very unique in that typically or annually, there's been, over the past number of years, around $3.5 billion of credit deployed by the Treasury, by the CDFI Fund. This round, there's going to be $7 billion, so double the amount of credit into the marketplace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So oftentimes, when we speak to tribes, tribal government, tribal leadership, there's a sense of frustration with this program in that there isn't necessarily a dedicated allocation of credit but for a few CDEs that are tribal-specific focused and the fact that it's a competitive program. So they like to use it, but their project wasn't deemed competitive enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I would argue or suggest that with this round, there's not going to be a whole lot of room for excuses if you wanted to use the program but didn't take advantage of it. Because there's double the amount of credits that's gonna be deployed and probably sometime later this quarter, likely after the election, but sometime late 2016, perhaps early into 2017, where there's gonna be a flood of $7 billion of credits into the market.</p>
<p>So from a credit to a project perspective, the ratio will be higher than it ever has been. And there's going to be a lot of LDPs looking for multiple projects to put credit into, likely early in 2017.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So if you've got a project that's more than on the drawing board that you feel like is close to being shovel-ready or will be in early 2017, you need to start talking to these CDEs now, even before the credits are awarded, so they know you're out there. You're on their radar, and if and when they are awarded – are lucky enough to be awarded credits due to the competitive application process – they can reach back out to you, and you can engage in discussions about how to acquire an allocation in new markets and ideally monetize them for the benefit of your project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That being said, like I said, the program's been recently extended for five years, so we've got a bit of runway here. If you're project isn't necessarily ready to go within the next, let's say, six months, the program will continue to provide, like, the $3.5 billion of allocation to the market on an annual basis for the next 5 years. And it never hurts, particularly with this program, to start getting educated about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So just keep that in mind if, again, this seems like a very exciting opportunity, but you've got a project that's maybe going through NEPA process and isn't gonna be ready to be built for another nine months, for example, but seems like it would be a good project. This program's not going anywhere. So next slide, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just a real quick overview of what our experience with the program. We've been involved with this since 2000. We play a lot of different roles in this program. We help CDEs put applications together. We help developers or borrowers source credits. We help bring tax equity investors who are generally the U.S. Banks, the Wells Fargos, the Chases of the world that like to invest in these types of projects. We bring them to the table and really help navigate what can be a very complex process from getting a commitment of an allocation to a closing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So very familiar with the program, and again, my role really is to intersect this program with clients that we have or folks that we have that are working energy initiatives. So with that, I'm going to conclude my portion of the presentation. I know there's contact information, and likely, there'll be questions at the end. So thank you very much, and we'll go to the next presenter, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Thank you, Joel. Excellent. Brian, give me a moment to get your slide deck up and – I think that's as large as it's gonna get, Brian. Does it look okay from your side?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brian Lipscomb:         It looks good. One thing you might do is maximize the – if you maximize the PDF or Adobe Acrobat, then it might get a little bigger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           I think so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brian Lipscomb:         Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brian Lipscomb:         Good enough. Well, thanks and for the invitation to join. And again, my name is Brian Lipscomb. I'm the CEO for Energy Keepers, Incorporated, or in Salish, it's SXʷNQ̓EʔELS L SUW̓EČM and in Kootenai, it's KSUKⱠIⱠMUMAⱠ ʾA·K̓͏AⱠMUKWAʾITS. So Randy's assured me that by the end of the program, you'll all be ready to say those words and be trained in some of our Native languages here on the Flathead Indian Reservation. Next slide, please, Randy.</p>
<p>                                   </p>
<p>                                    Okay. When I first start talking about this project, I always like to try to remind people of where it is and where it sits and the significance of this site for us. Our company operates the Se̓liš Ksanka Ql̓ispe̓ Dam, and it was constructed in the middle of our reservation during the allotment era or the assimilation era that was imposed upon tribes in the early part of the 1900s. And it was a built at a site that is pretty significant from a cultural perspective and a religious and resource perspective for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are pictures of the Lower Flathead River where the facility was constructed. Prior to its construction in the early – well, actually, the late 1920s was when these photos were taken. Next slide, please. Oops. One more up. Randy, that's a _____ _____ _____ _____ there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[Crosstalk]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           I apologize. Let me – I'm not used to TDS. Hold on. Let's see. Okay. How's that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brian Lipscomb:         There you go. Over the course of time, we were able to actually reacquire this facility from the private who constructed it. The facility is 380-foot-long concrete-arch dam. There are two other components to the arch dam itself. There's a gravity dam and then an earth-filled dam on the far left side of the picture if you're looking in the lower left-hand corner photo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    It's connected to a power plant through two 800-foot penstocks that run down through the cliff that you see if you're looking in the upper right-hand photo. Just to the left side of the dam is where the penstocks go through, actually, that rock outcropping, and the powerhouse itself is the small square, almost blends in with the rock cliff quite a ways downstream from the facility. That powerhouse generates – has the capacity to generate 288 megawatts of electricity. On an annual average, it's about 1.1 million-megawatt hours per year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    The reservoir that is created by this facility is really the top ten feet of Flathead Lake, which is the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi. It's 1.2 million acre-feet of storage. Overall, it's part of the Columbia Basin flood control system coordinated through the Pacific Northwest Coordination Agreement, which we're parties to. And overall, the facility is in good condition, although it's 80 years old, along with the concrete.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several parts of the structure and powerhouse are projected to last many more decades into the future. Mechanical aspects are all, as with other hydro facilities, due for reconstruction and rebuild. So we're in the process of doing that. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This shows the overall system within the Columbia Basin, and where this facility sits within it, it is the second-highest facility on that graph. And the former name that you see was named Kerr, which was the former president of the Montana Power Company who constructed the facilities in the 1930s. Of course, now, it's renamed to the Se̓liš Ksanka Ql̓ispe̓ Project. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an overall history of the project itself and how long we've been dealing with it. As I said, it's really a product of assimilation policies that were implemented in the early 1900s. The original license for this facility was issued in 1930 to the Rocky Mountain Power Company who then constructed the facility over the course of the next 9 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That first 50-year licensed period, we went back and forth a lot with the company, dealing mostly with what the land rental charge ought to be for the facility since it sat on tribal land and, in fact, used tribal water – tribal resources to generate the power. So a lot of dispute back and forth. We ended that first license period in 1980. Annual rental charge was about $2.5 million.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the tribe solution to it was to compete for the license. So in 1976, when the Montana Power Company filed for re-licensure of the project, the tribes filed a competing license application, as well. Over the next nine years, then, we disputed with the Montana Power Company in front of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over who ought to get the license.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We ended with the settlement, whereby the Montana Power Company proposed to us that we take a lesser land rental charge in exchange for them having the facility for the first 30 years of the next license, which would run from 1985 to 2035. And then, we as a tribe, would have the opportunity to acquire it for the last 20 years of the license.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that was the deal that was struck, now, 30 years ago. We have gone through a couple changes in ownership since then: 1999 PPL Montana acquired the facility from Montana Power Company. PPL is Pennsylvania Power and Light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, eventually, they sold to Northwestern Energy. Those conditions of settlement that were placed into the license carried through to the subsequent owners. So we were still able to exercise our opportunity to acquire the facility for original cost of construction, less depreciation, which we did about a year and two months ago. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Energy Keepers was the strategic corporation set up by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to hold the facility and operate the facility. Our business structure is to operate it as a independent power producer. So the energy that we generate, the 1.1 average annual megawatts, are sold into the wholesale market to various customers, including large industrial customers that are directly connected to the grid or utilities that need to bring it to the retail market, as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Probably important to get a feel for our reservation here to understand why it is that we don't bring this directly to the reservation residents. We have a tribally run, federally owned distribution utility here on our reservation that is actually interconnected with the Bonneville Power Administration control area and receives power from BPA. So we were not in need per se of low-cost renewable power to serve our membership here on the reservation. We've been operating that utility since 1986, and have – it's still are in the lowest from a per megawatt-hour energy value to our customers here on the reservation through that utility, so not a need for us to bring it here locally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, the facility – used to be Kerr Project – is actually interconnected with Northwestern Energy's transmission or control area. So we sell into that, primarily the customers that are interconnected with the Northwestern transmission system, and not the BPA transmission system. So we'd have to cross a couple legs of transmission, actually, to get it to our next-door neighbors. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the first year of operations, we've had a very challenging year. We started out – it was actually the driest year on record as we took over the facility, so we had operations that were a little low as we went through the first quarter of operations. Coming out of that, we got about normal as far as snowfall in the upper basin here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Located where we're at in the northwest part of Montana, most of our moisture comes in the form of snow into the mountains. And then, we manage it as it comes off in the spring and refill that 1.2 million acre-feet. And this graph kinda represents how we came out of the system or out of this year's, if you will, the _____ _____, when it came into the facility, and how we captured it really quite early, which was an anomaly for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, as we're looking out at a year later, we are just now ending the first month of operation of our second full year. And in that first month, October, we have the exact opposite of last year. We just experienced an October that is the wettest on record, and so we're now chasing water from a different perspective. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This shows overall production. We're about average, from a production standpoint, for the first year of operations, right about the one million megawatt-hour mark. We were selling into that wholesale market, which, from a value perspective was, end of the year, about $17.25 – $17.50 per megawatt-hour. We had some other revenue sources that come to us as part of being owner of the facility. So overall gross revenue for us is just north of $20 million for the first year of operation. Next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that kinda gives you a quick overall picture of the project itself. The planning and the savings for this project actually started about 40 years ago in 1976. Of course when we filed our first competing license application, the tribe started making initial investments into this project. After the settlement in 1985, the tribes created a reserve fund to acquire this facility, invested in that reserve fund over the course of time. So that was the primary source of revenue for us as we went into this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But overall, investment into the project is more than just the project acquisition itself. You have startup costs. You have reserve costs for various reserve funds to assure smooth operation of a company this size. So overall, the total investment was about double what the tribes had available at the time to invest in this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a result, then, we had initial pursuit of the revenue bonds to fund the project. We looked a little bit at new market tax credits or other tax credit programs. They really didn't fit for us as a triable corporation. We don't have tax burdens, so there was no benefit there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, we didn't wanna bring in a partner to the project given the value of the resource from a tribal perspective. We wanted to bring it back into complete tribal ownership. So those tax credit programs really didn't fit for us from that perspective, so we were pursuing a straight revenue bond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That, we were getting quite a ways down that path, so I'll speak a little bit about what we learned going through that project for process as a tribal corporation – tribal startup corporation in the energy business. And then, lastly, we did, at the end, also need to bring in a fairly substantial line of credit, so I'll speak to that from both of those perspectives, the items that we learned along the way. So next slide, please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So overall, the essential elements for financing, then, as we talk to major lending institutions across the country, the first thing that people would want to see or those institutions would wanna see is, "What's the tribal commitment?" So number one, what's the skin in the game, first of all? So what's the tribal investment into the project? Of course, there was substantial tribal investment into it – about half of the overall revenue need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secondly, then, they also wanted to see a sound commitment from a structure perspective. So what was the government's desire to complete the project? Was there a corporation established? What were the bylaws for the corporation? How was it established?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tribes have many opportunities to develop corporations. Ours is a Section 17 corporation under the Indian Reorganization Act. So we need to be producing our charter to show the connection between the tribal government as the shareholder to the board of directors to the corporation. They wanted to see that the corporation itself was soundly staffed and had the appropriate expertise to run the facility, to produce the energy, and ultimately get that energy sold out to the wholesale market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, then, once all those structural aspects and kinda commitment aspects were covered, then we get into the numbers. Obviously, the project, at the end of the day, needs to pencil out from our perspective because we had the opportunity to invest in this with really a deferred rental payment, which I won't get into too much today. But the overall cost of the project was $18.3 million, original cost of construction, less depreciation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And you might say, "Well, that's a small number," and it is a small number. But there's 30 years of investment to get us there, initially. So but from a production perspective, when you have a $18.3 million hydro asset that produces 1.1 million megawatt-hours an average annual basis of electricity. It's pretty easy to see how it can pencil out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So from that perspective, we had a good pro forma, but then, we also go through not only explaining the pro forma and the various cost structures. And for us, there is a significant land rental payment that goes back to the tribe as a primary source of revenue for the tribal government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But in addition, then, because we're operating in the open market or the commodities that the wholesale power market's really a commodities market, so there's various stress testing that we need to go through to not only show how the facility would work in a low-water year but also a low-market year. So it has various stress testing on that pro forma that we go through, as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, as I said, we did not need to go out for a revenue bond, so the tribe was able to provide the additional funding through a loan from the tribal government to Energy Keepers, Incorporated to cover our ultimate financing needs. But because we're operating in the wholesale market, we need to have a line of credit totaling $20 million for that first year of operation. And so we went through this same process when we secured that line of credit with a major lending institution to back our credit requirements with our counterparts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that's kind of a basic overall structure of what we've learned going through the process. As we go forward, we'll have major capital investment in the facility. I expect to spend between $20 million and $30 million over the next decade in rehab and betterment of the facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we'll be exploring – again, we'll look back at the tax credit opportunities to see if there's opportunity for us there. We'll also look at grant funding, and we'll look at loan guarantees from the federal government, as well. So that's kind of an overview, if you will, of what we learned and where we ended up as we went through the process. And that's the end of my presentation, Randy, so I'll stop there, and we can jump into questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Great. Thank, Brian. Let me see what questions we have, and then, we'll get into those. Just bear with me a moment. Okay, here's our first question: "Don't tribes count as government nonprofit? I don't understand why a tribe would be paying taxes."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            So this is Paul. I'm –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Crosstalk]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       _____ _____ _____ – oh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            Oh, go ahead, Joel. Yeah, you started to take it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       Sure. I was just gonna say that's correct. And again, I think the key takeaway from either the new market tax credit funding opportunity or the investment production tax credit is that you gotta have a taxable entity as a "partner" in the transaction. Now, it's different when you're talking about new market tax credits, as I discussed, because the CDE, that CDE that I discussed, allocates the credits to your project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    An investor purchases those credits, more or less, and the proceeds from that transaction are loaned to the project. So they're not an actual – they're a partner in as much as you need them to provide financing, but they are not, at any point in time, an owner in the project for tax purposes. The ITC and PPC are a little different, where you need to partner with someone who will need to be an owner in the project for tax purposes and invest in the projects in exchange for credits and then exit at a later time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the question or the individual with the question is accurate. Tribes generally do not pay taxes, income tax, federal income tax, so you need that third party. The means by which that third party provides your funding for new market tax credits vs. the traditional energy tax credits is a bit different.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            Yeah. That's a great point. And one thing I would just add is we've been working – if there's any representatives from Alaskan Native corporations, they're kind of unique entities that could be potential partners to this structure if they're looking for a  for-profit participant in the project or, as Joel mentioned, a third-party-for-profit partner into the project. So yep, and I probably wasn't clear enough on that, but it was a great question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       And typically, these entities are banks. So when you say – you know, it's, again, the Chase, JP Morgan, the U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo. There's maybe, on the energy side – hmm – 25 to 30 different participants in the tax equity market. And new market tax credits is a bit smaller circle of institutions that provide this type of financing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            And actually, maybe one other thing I would add, Joel, is just that for the PTC or the ITC structure, there can be structures where that owner of the project, initially, is eventually structured out of the projects so the tribe can reacquire ownership of the project after those tax credits are expired. Either five or six years in the case for solar, maybe at year ten for the wind project. So oftentimes, we deal with tribes that wanna retain ownership, and it's a matter of if they're comfortable reacquiring the ownership in the project once the tax credits have been utilized.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Thanks, Paul and Joel. Brian, a question specific to you: "Were you able to take over the dam and produce power based on the ownership of the top ten acre-feet?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brian Lipscomb:         So I'm not sure – if the question is, "What gave us the authority to purchase the facility?" it was not just the top ten acre-feet. The facility sits on tribal land, and it was a dispute in front of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1985 as to who would be the appropriate entity to own that facility going forward under the second license. So that's what gave us the authority to acquire it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    If the question is more related to the standpoint of, "What provided us the water to generate electricity?" yeah, it's the 1.2 million acre-feet of storage, plus the traditional stream flow, as well, that runs through the facility itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Thank you, Brian. That's all the written questions. Please submit anymore written questions that you may have, and let's see if there are any raised hands. And if you wanna ask our panel a question directly, please just click the Raise Your Hand icon, and I'll unmute you so you can ask your question directly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            Randy, I had a question for Joel if there aren't any, but go ahead and –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    [Crosstalk]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           You bet. Mm-hmm. Nope – go for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            I was wondering if, Joel, if you could walk us through a little bit of a timeline of what the typical new market tax credit process might look like?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       Sure – and a good question because patience and persistence are definitely required as part of the new markets process. So from, you know, no different than going out and trying to get a loan or a commitment from an equity investor, you take your project, and you put a – essentially, do initial preliminary evaluation to confirm it's a good candidate or everybody thinks this is a good candidate to go get credits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    From there, you put a little package together that you "shop" to these CDEs. Assuming CDEs have interest, just like a bank would, they would issue you a term sheet that says, "Here's the amount of credits we wanna put into your project," the terms of the transaction, that sorta thing – any other requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    And once that term sheet or multiple term sheets – because there can be more than one CDE putting credits into a single project or transaction. Once those term sheets are executed, it's really a march toward a closing just like any other loan or financial transaction closing to get all the due diligence completed, all the documents in place, and ultimately an injection of capital to the borrower or through the project for use in the project. So that whole process, on a very well-put-together-ready-to-go project might take three months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    And I would say the more typical project might be four to six months from getting that term sheet signed to getting to a close where you've got the capital. So it's not a quick process. It's very involved. It involves accountants, attorneys, and obviously needs an internal – I would say from a tribe's perspective – project champion to make sure things are continuing to roll forward. Everybody's aware of what's being asked of the tribe, what documents need to be signed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    But as to your question, it's about a four- to six-month timeline from start to finish when it's all said and done, and that's more typical than not. And again, you've gotta say, "Is it worth going through that process as efficiently as possible for the net benefit?" More often than not, it is, but that's everyone's individual decision. So it's process to be sure. Good question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Next question: "Is there a website where CDEs can be reviewed and identified on a annual and quarterly basis?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       Yes. All that information is publicly available in terms of what CDEs were allocated credits in what year. I don't know the exact name of the website. It would be at the CDFI Fund under the Department of Treasury.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps if the presentations are gonna be posted, I could find out and list that within the body of my presentation or at the end, where I've got a couple other useful links on the second to last slide of my deck. Or I could work with Randy and DOE to put post that somewhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But yes, that is all public information in terms of which CDEs get credit from year to year. And you can also evaluate what the CDE's mission is, what their geography is, and other information about the specific CDE. And the announcement of who gets the credits is a public announcement. So all that information is publicly available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Well, thanks, Joel. And I'll hold up on posting the slides so when you get a chance to add that link, just send me the updated deck, and we'll post the slides at that point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       Will do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. It still doesn't look like any raised hands. Let me go back to the written questions. If there are no more written questions – ah, looks like there may be one here. "Is there a case study that can be shared that shows a DOE BIA energy grant primed with new market tax credits and maybe ITC?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       I'm not aware of any that have used all three. There certainly would be nothing to prohibit usage of all three. We've certainly seen the ITC had been involved in transactions where the ITC new market tax credits and other – let's say a state grant, for example, was used or some other form of incentive-based funding just to the specific DOE ICC and MTC. I'm just not aware of a case study off of the top of my head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But there's obviously no issue, in my mind, as to using all three in conjunction. We've certainly seen similar or even more complex transactions using four or five different sources of funding. So programs are generally pretty compatible in terms of adding those layers. I don't know if others on the call have seen some – Paul, if you've seen that or not through your experience at NREL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            I agree. It seems like two of the three in some combination, there's examples of. But all three is probably a little more challenging to find specifically in the tribal context.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Randy Manion:           Okay. Thank you. Let's see if there are any more questions. I'll just go back to the attendees real quick here, see if there are any raised hands. And that looks like it's it. So with that, I wanna pull out the last slide here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have one webinar left for 2016 webinar series on Energy and Economic Success Studies, November 30th. I wanna thank our speakers, Lizana, Paul, Joel, and Brian for doing a great job on complicated topics. And with that, this concludes today's webinar, and thank you all, again, for participating, and we look forward to having you on next month. Bye-bye.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul Schwabe:            Thank you, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lizana Pierce:            Thanks, Randy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joel Laubenstein:       Thanks, Randy.</p>
