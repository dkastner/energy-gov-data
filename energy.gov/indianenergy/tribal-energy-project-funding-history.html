The DOE funding, awarded through a competitive process, is expected to be matched by up to $27 million in public and private investment, for a total value of nearly $41 million.</p>
<p>In addition to the Alaska Native villages, the funding will go to tribes in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin. Of the 36 Native American Tribes and villages whose projects have been selected for negotiation, eight projects will provide weatherization training and resources to tribal members, 17 projects will focus on assessing the feasibility of renewable energy development and energy efficiency deployment on tribal lands, and 11 projects will fund the development of renewable energy projects and the deployment of energy efficiency measures on tribal lands and villages. The renewable energy projects will employ hydropower and wind power, while the feasibility studies will be examining a wide range of renewable energy technologies.</p>

<div class="ready-accordion"> <span class="ready-accordion-header">2008</span>
<p>In FY 2008, DOE issued two project funding opportunity announcements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renewable Energy Deployment in Alaska Native Villages</li>
<li>Renewable Energy or Energy Efficiency Deployment in Indian Country (Contiguous 48 States).</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications for financial assistance were solicited from federally recognized tribes, Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations, and tribal energy resource development organizations.</p>
<p>Two applications were selected for funding in FY 2008. Following is the text of the award announcement.</p>
<h5>Award Announcement</h5>
<p>DOE will make available up to $2.3 million for two renewable energy projects selected for negotiation of awards that support the advancement of renewable energy technologies on tribal lands and in rural Alaskan villages.</p>
<p>The Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments, a consortium of ten Gwich'in and Koyukon Athabascan tribes in 10 remote villages along Alaska's Yukon River, will develop a biomass energy program. Their Fort Yukon Wood Energy Project will use wood fuel to displace diesel fuel used for heating. The region is rich in forest resources but the tribes face a daily struggle to meet their communities' energy needs. The Fort Yukon school and gym use 30,000 gallons of fuel oil annually for heat, and that fuel oil must be flown or barged in to each community. Once established, this project will serve as a model for similar sustainable biomass projects in Interior Alaska.</p>
<p>Also selected was the Yakama Nations' Wapato Hydroelectric Project. Under this project, the Yakama Nation in Washington state will install inflow water turbines (as part of their Wapato Irrigation Project) to generate one megawatt of electricity. The use of the flow of water to generate electricity is not expected to interfere with the primary purpose of the water system which will continue to supply irrigation to the 142,000 acres of land on the Yakama Reservation.</p>
<p>The awards are cost-shared, with the Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments requesting $1.2 million in DOE funding and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation requesting about $1.1 million.</p>

<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">2000-2001</span> 
<p>In FY 2000, in support of Executive Order 13021, DOE issued a solicitation for renewable energy development at tribal colleges and universities. The solicitation was titled "Feasibility Studies for Potential Application of Renewable Energy Technologies at Tribal Colleges and Universities."</p>
<p>The main objective of this solicitation was to demonstrate the viability of installing renewable energy systems at tribal colleges and universities. The second objective was to integrate renewable energy courses into educational programs and science curricula, with an emphasis on experiential teaching so students and their communities could learn about the use and benefits of these technologies.</p>
<p>The program was designed with two phases. The initial phase focused on feasibility studies conducted by tribal colleges and universities (and their selected partners and subcontractors). Its purpose was to determine the most appropriate renewable energy technologies to implement, and how to integrate those technologies with an educational and outreach program to the tribal community. The second phase focused on the installation of the renewable energy hardware and implementation of the related educational program.</p>
<p>Fourteen tribal colleges and universities responded to the solicitation, resulting in seven one-year feasibility studies being awarded. Total DOE funds for the feasibility study phase were $700,000. Through a competitive process, one tribal college, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, was awarded subsequent funding to install renewable energy hardware and integrate renewable energy into their curricula.</p>
</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">1999 </span>
<p>In FY 1999, DOE's Golden Field Office issued a solicitation for "Remote Applications of Renewable Power Technologies on Native American Lands." The solicitation asked tribes to develop and field-validate renewable power systems on reservations or tribally owned lands.</p>
<p>DOE only considered applications that included, as an active partner, a federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaskan Native corporation on whose reservation or other tribally owned lands the systems would be located.</p>
<p>DOE competitively awarded and funded eight projects, totaling $1.8 million. As a result, tribes installed solar electric (photovoltaic) and solar hot water heating systems and wind turbines, and demonstrated the potential for job creation, market penetration of renewable power technology, replicability, and economic and environmental benefits to the participating tribes or tribal members.</p>
</div>
<div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">1994-1995 </span>
<p>In 1994, a competitive solicitation was issued by DOE's Denver Regional Office, which resulted in 17 projects. A second solicitation was issued in 1995, which resulted in 18 projects. Total funding for these 35 projects was $6.5 million.</p>
<p>Title XXVI "Indian Energy Resources" of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486) authorized the Secretary of Energy to establish a demonstration program to assist Indian Tribes in pursuing energy self-sufficiency, and to promote the development of energy industries on tribal lands.</p>
