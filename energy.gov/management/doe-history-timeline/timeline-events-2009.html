<p><strong>January 26, 2009</strong><br />President Obama, in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/Fromperiltoprogress" target="_self">remarks</a> on Jobs, Energy Independence, and Climate Change in the East Room of the White House, says that at a time of "great challenge for America, no single issue is as fundamental to our future as energy." Dependence on oil, he notes, "is one of the most serious threats that our nation has faced. It bankrolls dictators, pays for nuclear proliferation, and funds both sides of our struggle against terrorism. It puts the American people at the mercy of shifting gas prices, stifles innovation and sets back our ability to compete." The President declares that "it will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil, while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs." He announces "first steps on our journey toward energy independence": 1) the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan currently before Congress places a down payment on the energy economy by doubling the capacity to generate alternative energy over the next three years, laying down 3,000 miles of transmission lines, making 75 percent of federal buildings more efficient, and weatherizing 2 million homes; 2) to ensure that the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow are built in the U.S., the Department of Transportation will <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/The_Energy_Independence_and_Security_Act_of_2007" target="_self">implement new standards</a> for model year 2011; 3) the federal government will work with the states in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the Environmental Protection Agency will "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/California_Request_for_Waiver_Under_the_Clean_Air_Act" target="_self">immediately review</a> the denial of the California waiver request" to implement more stringent emissions standards for new motor vehicles; 4) the Administration "will make it clear to the world that America is ready to lead. . . . [and] call together a truly global coalition. . . . [that] will ensure that nations like China and India are doing their part."</p>

"For the last few years, I've talked about [energy] issues with Americans from one end of this country to another," the President tells his audience. "And Washington may not be ready to get serious about energy independence, but I am. And so are you. And so are theAmerican people. Inaction is not an option that is acceptable to me and it's certainly not acceptable to the American people-not on energy, not on the economy, not at this critical moment." President Obama thanks DOE staffers for having "done so much on behalf of the country each and every day" and tells them their "mission is so important, and it's only going to grow as we transform the ways we produce energy and use energy for the sake of our environment, for the sake of our security, and for the sake of our economy." The President also announces that he has signed a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ApplianceEfficiencyStandards" target="_self">presidential memorandum</a> requesting that the Department set new efficiency standards for common household appliances.</p>

The leaders discuss practical ways to develop of clean energy technologies, reduce greenhouse gases, and combat climate change. They establish a senior-level U.S.-Canada Clean Energy Dialogue that will cooperate on several critical energy science and technology issues, including: 1) expanding clean energy research and development, 2) developing and deploying clean energy technology, and 3) building a more efficient electric grid based on clean and renewable generation. U.S. and Canadian officials will meet in the coming weeks to launch the clean energy dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>February 19, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-changes-expedite-economic-recovery-funding.html" target="_self">announces</a> a reorganization of DOE's dispersal of direct loans, loan guarantees, and funding contained in the new American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The goal of the restructuring is to expedite disbursement of money to begin investments in a new energy economy that will put Americans back to work and create millions of new jobs. By cutting paperwork, processing applications on a rolling basis, and drawing on lessons from the private sector and other agencies, the Department will be in a position to: 1) begin offering loan guarantees under the Department's previous loan guarantee program by late April or early May; 2) begin offering loan guarantees under the new Recovery legislation by early summer; and 3) Disperse 70 percent of the investment from the American Recovery and Reinvestment plan by the end of 2010.</p>
<p><strong>February 19, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu, speaking at an energy forum, states that building power lines tied to renewable energy is a national priority but the input of states cannot be ignored. "As the country transitions to newer cleaner forms of energy, carbon-free renewable energy, in a big way, we desperately need a national transmission system overlay," the Secretary says. "There's a realization now among our leaders that electricity transmission and distribution is a national issue. Just as Eisenhower said during his first year, in his first year, we need a national highway system for the sake of national security. Just as we realized that we needed gas pipelines, that this was a national issue. Now we realize, as we go to a higher and higher fraction of renewables, that the renewables are dispersed around the country."</p>

<p><strong>February 24, 2009</strong><br />President Obama, in his first <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress" target="_self">address</a> to a joint session of Congress, states that the "three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future" are energy, health care, and education. "It begins with energy," the President notes. "We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea." Declaring that "it is time for America to lead again," President Obama says that "to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. And to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in America."</p>

At $26.4 billion, the Department's FY 2010 proposed budget is $1.9 billion more than the current $24.5-billion budget based on the FY 2008 appropriations bill continued by Congress after it failed to pass a FY 2009 budget in September 2008. The FY 2010 budget total does not include American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding for DOE activities of $38.7 billion, which will be spread out over several years. The President's Budget Message emphasizes the "creation of a clean energy economy" and the development of "new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs and more savings, putting us on the path toward energy independence for our Nation and a cleaner, safer planet in the process." The DOE section of the proposal notes that the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste program "will be scaled back to those costs necessary to answer inquiries from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, while the Administration devises a new strategy toward nuclear waste disposal." DOE Press Secretary Stephanie Mueller tells reporters that "Yucca Mountain is not an option, and the new administration is starting the process of finding a better solution for management of our nuclear waste." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) comments that "this represents our most significant victory to date in our battle to protect Nevada from becoming the country's toxic wasteland."</p>

<p><strong>March 13, 2009</strong><br />The Department <a href="../../articles/secretary-chu-stresses-global-cooperation-energy-economic-and-climate-challenges-talks.html" target="_self">announces</a> that Secretary Chu, in discussion over the past several weeks with a broad range of world energy ministers, has "stressed the need for global cooperation on energy, economic and climate challenges." The Secretary told "representatives of OPEC nations that price volatility is not in the best interests of the global economy, and urged them to take this into account during their March 15 meeting. But he has also noted that, because the United States consumes almost 20 percent of the world's oil, by far the most effective way for us to reduce prices is to become more efficient and consume less oil. Additionally, he has conveyed to world energy ministers the Administration's belief that the most effective way to make the world economy less vulnerable to price spikes in oil markets is to diversify our energy sources."</p>

Explaining his climate-change program for the first time to a national audience, the President notes that with "cap and trade, the broader principle is that we've got to move to a new energy era, and that means moving away from polluting energy sources towards cleaner energy sources. That is a potential engine for economic growth. I think cap and trade is the best way, from my perspective, to achieve some of those gains because what it does is it starts pricing the pollution that's being sent into the atmosphere. The way it's structured has to take into account regional differences; it has to protect consumers from huge spikes in electricity prices. So there are a lot of technical issues that are going to have to be sorted through." President Obama adds that cap and trade "will be authorized, we'll get it done and I will sign it."</p>

Noting that "the existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War," the President states "clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons" and enumerates the "concrete steps" to be taken toward this goal. The U.S. will: 1) reduce the role of nuclear weapons in its national security strategy and urge others to do the same, 2) negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians this year, 3) pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 4) seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons, 5) strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation, and 6) launch a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years. To strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty, President Obama says, "we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause. And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation." The President calls for a "Global Summit on Nuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year."</p>
<p><strong>April 7, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu delivers the keynote address at the 2009 Energy Conference sponsored by DOE's Energy Information Administration. Afterwards, he talks with reporters about the value of investing in carbon capture and storage. "Even if the United States or Europe turns its back on coal, India and China will not," the Secretary notes. "Quite frankly I doubt if the United States will turn its back on coal. We are generating over 50 percent of our electrical energy from coal." Regarding clean-coal technology, the Secretary says "it would take probably a minimum of eight years or more to really have confidence that these technologies will work in a cost-effective way." In the short term, "energy efficiency, energy conservation are where the greatest gains will be." When asked about the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel, the Secretary replies that it is "a possibility" but he is "agnostic" about it. Use of natural gas for transportation "will put a strain on natural gas for industrial uses, for heating, and other things." Advanced biofuels, he adds, might be a better option.</p>

<p><strong>May 7, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../articles/secretary-chu-presidents-energy-budget-creates-jobs-restores-americas-scientific-leadership.html" target="_self">details</a> President Obama's $26.4 billion <a href="http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/10budget/Start.htm" target="_self">Fiscal Year 2010 budget request</a> for DOE released in outline February 26. According to DOE, the budget: cuts funding for programs that are not needed or are not as effective as other investments such as more than $200 million in oil and gas company research that the companies can and do fund on their own, expands the use of clean, renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure, supports the development of a smart and secure electricity grid, helps restore America's leadership in scientific research and innovation, makes significant investments in low-emissions plug-in and hybrid vehicles, nuclear energy, and clean coal technologies, and supports the ongoing security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Up less than one percent from the FY 2009 budget enacted in the 2009 omnibus spending bill that the President signed on March 11, the 2010 budget "complements" the $38.7 billion DOE will invest as part of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. "A lot of our activities benefited from significant investments through the recovery act," notes Steve Isakowitz, DOE's chief financial officer. "In those instances where we felt we had ample funds in the recovery act, it meant that we didn't have to put quite as much in the 2010."</p>

Focusing on climate change, the Secretary observes that "overwhelming scientific evidence shows that carbon dioxide from human activity has increased the atmospheric level of CO2 by roughly 40 percent, a level one- third higher than any time in the last 800,000 years. There is also a consensus that CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions have caused our planet to change. Already, we have seen the loss of about half of the summer arctic polar ice cap since the 1950s, a dramatically accelerating rise in sea level, and the loss of over two thousand cubic miles of glacial ice, not on geological time scales but over a mere hundred years." The Secretary states that "denial of the climate change problem will not change our destiny; a comprehensive energy and climate bill that caps and then reduces carbon emissions will."</p>

The Secretary also delivers a major address to an audience of top scientists, faculty and students at Tsinghua University focusing on the growing threat China and the U.S. face from climate change, from extreme heat waves to declining rice and agricultural production to flooding of major urban areas in coastal regions. The Secretary stresses that dealing with climate change presents opportunities as well as challenges, including the opportunity to create millions of jobs in the clean energy sector. He outlines a number of solutions that the two countries are working to address, such as developing more efficient batteries, lower cost photovoltaics, and commercial scale carbon capture and sequestration technologies. "What the U.S. and what China does in the coming decades will actually, in large part, determine the fate of the world," Secretary Chu tells the students and faculty. "So it is very important that we in the U.S. move very aggressively towards decreasing the amount of carbon in the world, and I sincerely hope that China follows soon after."</p>
<p><strong>July 15, 2009</strong><br />In Beijing, China, Secretary Chu, Chinese Minister of Science Wan Gang, and Administrator of National Energy Administration Zhang Guo Bao <a href="../../articles/us-china-clean-energy-research-center-announced.html" target="_self">announce</a> plans to develop a U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center. The Center would facilitate joint research and development on clean energy by teams of scientists and engineers from the U.S. and China, as well as serve as a clearinghouse to help researchers in each country.

<p><strong>July 15, 2009</strong><br />The Department <a href="../../articles/doe-announces-525-million-concentrating-solar-power-research-and-development.html" target="_self">announces</a> plans to provide up to $52.5 million to research, develop, and demonstrate Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems capable of providing low-cost electrical power both day and night. CSP technologies concentrate the sun's energy and capture that energy as heat, which then drives an engine or turbine to produce electrical power. CSP plants can include low-cost energy storage, which allows them to provide electricity even when the sun is not shining. CSP technologies currently used in utility-scale power plants typically do not have the capability/capacity for storage, operating only during daytime hours. These projects will seek to improve technology and novel system designs to extend operation to an average of about 18 hours per day, a level of production that would make it possible for a CSP plant to displace a traditional coal power plant.</p>

<p><strong>July 27, 2009</strong><br />President Obama, in opening <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-the-US/China-Strategic-and-Economic-Dialogue" target="_self">remarks</a> at the Strategic Economic Dialogue between the United States and China in Washington, D.C., notes that a partnership between the two nations is "a prerequisite for progress on many of the most pressing global challenges." Two of the four challenges the President discusses are energy and non-proliferation. On energy, the President notes that the U.S. and China "are the two largest consumers of energy in the world. We are also the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world. Let's be frank: Neither of us profits from a growing dependence on foreign oil, nor can we spare our people from the ravages of climate change unless we cooperate. Common sense calls upon us to act in concert." On non-proliferation, the President observes that "the more nations acquire these weapons, the more likely it is that they will be used. Neither America nor China has an interest in a terrorist acquiring a bomb, or a nuclear arms race breaking out in East Asia. That is why we must continue our collaboration to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and make it clear to North Korea that the path to security and respect can be traveled if they meet their obligations. And that is why we must also be united in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and urging the Islamic Republic to live up to its international obligations."</p>

<p><strong>September 30, 2009</strong><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issues a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-913" target="_self">report</a> evaluating DOE's tank waste cleanup strategy at the Hanford Site. The GAO finds that "critical uncertainties" call into question the strategy's success. "Technical uncertainties include whether DOE can retrieve waste from tanks at the rate needed to support continuous operation of the waste treatment complex now under construction and whether key treatment technologies will work. Legal uncertainties include whether DOE can treat and dispose of some tank waste as other than high-level (highly radioactive) waste and how much residual waste can be left in the tanks when they are eventually closed. Such uncertainties could lead to significant cost increases and further delays in completing Hanford's tank waste cleanup activities."</p>

At the same time, "the recession, by curbing the growth in greenhouse-gas emissions, has made the task of transforming the energy sector easier by giving us an unprecedented, yet relatively narrow, window of opportunity to take action to concentrate investment on low-carbon technology." The IEA observes that with the "unexpected boom of North American unconventional gas production," a "glut of gas is looming" over the next several years.

As a result, "subsidies in the tens to hundreds of billions of dollars over that period will be needed if plug-ins are to achieve rapid penetration of the U.S. automotive market. Even with these efforts, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030."</p>
<p><strong>December 15, 2009</strong><br />President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/background-presidents-meeting-energy-efficiency-job-creation" target="_self">meets</a> with a group representing the labor, small business, and manufacturing communities-stakeholders in the shift to a more energy efficient economy. The President then visits a Home Depot in Alexandria, Virginia, to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-energy-efficiency-and-job-creation" target="_self">highlight</a> the importance of providing incentives to consumers who do energy retrofits on their homes. The President then has lunch at the White House with business leaders representing different parts of the supply chain-manufacturing, retail, and in-home audits and implementation-to discuss the opportunities for creating jobs through incentivizing home energy efficiency upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>December 16, 2009</strong><br />Vice President Biden is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/readout-vice-presidents-meeting-with-directors-national-security-laboratories-us-nu" target="_self">briefed</a> on the state of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile by the directors of DOE's three national security laboratories-Mike Anastasio from Los Alamos National Laboratory, George Miller from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Tom Hunter from Sandia National Laboratory. Secretary Chu, Deputy Secretary Poneman, National Nuclear Security Administrator Tom D'Agostino, and officials from the Departments of State and Defense are also present.</p>
<p><strong>December 16, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-2009-ernest-orlando-lawrence-award-winners.html" target="_self">announces</a> the winners of the 2009 E.O. Lawrence Award for their outstanding contributions in research and development supporting DOE and its missions. The six winners will receive a gold medal, a citation, and $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>December 17, 2009</strong><br />Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/12/133734.htm" target="_self">discusses</a> the "state of the negotiations" with the press. Secretary Clinton announces that the U.S. "is prepared to work with other countries toward a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the climate change needs of developing countries."</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2009</strong><br />President Obama arrives at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference. In <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-morning-plenary-session-united-nations-climate-change-conference" target="_self">remarks</a> at the Morning Plenary Session, the President states that he has come "not to talk, but to act." Noting that "our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now, and it hangs in the balance," he says "the pieces of [an] accord should now be clear." A series of afternoon meetings by President Obama with world leaders culminates in an early evening meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao of China, Prime Minister Singh of India, President Lula of Brazil, and President Zuma of South Africa, at which an agreement is reached to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius and to "take action to meet this objective consistent with science and on the basis of equity." The agreement calls for each nation to put concrete commitments into an appendix to the document. These commitments will then be subject to international consultation and analysis but will not be legally binding. President Obama, in a late evening "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-during-press-availability-copenhagen" target="_self">press availability</a>" calls the agreement a "meaningful and unprecedented breakthrough" even if only a "first step," conceding that emissions targets that are going to be set "will not be by themselves sufficient to get to where we need to get by 2050."</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-efforts-strengthen-us-electric-transmission-networks.html" target="_self">announces</a> award selections for $60 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to support transmission planning for the country's three interconnection transmission networks. The 6 awards will promote collaborative long-term analysis and planning for the Eastern, Western and Texas electricity interconnections, which will help states, utilities, grid operators, and others prepare for future growth in energy demand, renewable energy sources, and Smart Grid technologies. This is the first-ever effort to take a collaborative, comprehensive look across each of the three transmission interconnections. The Secretary also announces that he has joined with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Jon Wellinghoff to sign a <a href="https://energy.gov/news/documents/FINALDOE-FERCMOU.pdf" target="_self">Memorandum of Understanding</a> (pdf) between the agencies to coordinate efforts related to interconnection-level electric transmission planning.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2009</strong><br />The Department's Office of Science issues its <a href="http://www.sc.doe.gov/News_Information/News_Room/2009/ReportCards/index.htm" target="_self">FY 2009 Laboratory Performance Report Card</a> for the ten DOE laboratories under its purview.</p>
<p><strong>December 19, 2009</strong><br />Delegates from the 193 nations at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, after a sometimes heated debate lasting into the early hours of the morning, agree to "take note" of the <a href="../../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Funfccc.int%252Ffiles%252Fmeetings%252Fcop_15%252Fapplication%252Fpdf%252Fcop15_cph_auv.pdf.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">accord</a> (pdf) shaped by President Obama and the four other leaders the previous evening.</p>
<p><strong>December 22, 2009</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../articles/department-energy-invest-366m-energy-innovation-hubs.html" target="_self">outlines</a> DOE's plans to invest up to $366 million to establish and operate three new Energy Innovation Hubs focused on accelerating research and development in three key energy areas. Each Hub, to be funded at up to $122 million over five years, will bring together a multidisciplinary team of researchers in an effort to speed research and shorten the path from scientific discovery to technological development and commercial deployment of highly promising energy-related technologies. The three DOE Energy Innovation Hubs will focus on: 1) production of fuels directly from sunlight, 2) improving energy-efficient building systems design, and 3) computer modeling and simulation for the development of advanced nuclear reactors.</p>
<p><strong>December 22, 2009</strong><br />The Department's Office of Legacy Management <a href="http://www.lm.doe.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=6676" target="_self">opens</a> the Legacy Management Business Center (LMBC), a 59,000-square-foot facility in Morgantown, West Virginia, dedicated to storing, managing, and processing inactive, temporary DOE records from closed Cold War nuclear sites.</p>
