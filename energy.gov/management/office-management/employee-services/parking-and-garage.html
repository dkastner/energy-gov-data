<p>Temporary permits are sold in the Parking Booth located in the Forrestal garage for $5.00 each. You are allowed up to five (5) temporary permits per month for authorized employees.  Holders of temporary permits are required to comply with the procedures set forth in the <a href="https://energy.gov/management/downloads/forrestal-garage-parking-procedures">Forrestal Garage Parking Procedures</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>To obtain a One-Day Temporary Permit for Forrestal you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a Federal employee of the Department</li>
<li>Go to the Parking Booth located in the Forrestal garage, by the 12th Street entrance, on a standard workday before 3 p.m., provide the information specific to your vehicle and parking (as listed in the next bullet) and pay the fee.</li>
<li>The information needed in order to purchase a One-Day Temporary permit is:

<p>It is advised that you obtain the One-Day Temporary Permit at least one day in advance so that you may drive your vehicle directly into the garage.  If an unforeseen circumstance arises and you need to obtain a One-Day Temporary Permit for the same day parking you will need to obtain the permit prior to being provided access to the garage; security will not allow a vehicle into the garage that does not have a valid permit.  It is up to the driver to identify the best method to accomplish this task.</p>

<p><a name="Permit-Holder-Responsibilities" id="Permit-Holder-Responsibilities"><strong>Forrestal Garage Permit Holder Responsibilities - Update June, 2011</strong></a><br /><em>(for complete permit holder responsibilities please read this entire page)</em></p>
<p>The Forrestal Parking Office has experienced a surge in employees parking in the Forrestal garage without a valid parking permit.  This has resulted in employees being blocked in lanes and unable to contact the drivers to move their vehicles.  The Office of Administrative Management and Support and the Office of Headquarters Security Operations are working together to reduce unauthorized parking in the garage by enforcing the DOE parking rules that restrict access to the parking garage to authorized employees holding valid parking permits.</p>
<p>Effective June 1, 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>DOE Federal employees driving into the Forrestal garage must have a valid DOE security badge and a valid parking permit.  The parking permit must be displayed in their vehicles between the hours of 6:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.</li>
<li>Use of the 9th street garage entrance will be limited to DOE Federal employees with a valid security badge and a valid parking permit.  Visitors and employees who have forgotten or lost their security badge and who entering  the Forrestal parking garage must see the Protective Force officer at the 12th Street ramp.  Visitors must provide a DOE parking confirmation number and have their vehicle inspected before they will be permitted to enter the garage.  Parking attendants will direct visitors to their designated parking area.</li>
<li>To ensure the safety of Protective Force officers at the entrances, all permit holders should prominently display their parking permits on the right side (passenger side) of the vehicle’s front window.  This will allow the officers to inspect the parking permit without crossing in front of or behind vehicles entering the garage.</li>
<li>If personal vehicles are found parked in the Forrestal garage not displaying a valid parking permit, Parking Office staff will issue a Notice of Infraction.  Repeated instances of vehicles being parked in the garage without a valid parking permit displayed may result in ticketing and/or towing by the Federal Protective Service. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your cooperation is appreciated.  Please contact the Parking Office on (202) 586-5235 if you have any questions or need further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Garage Procedures</strong></p>
<p><a name="Garage-Guidelines" id="Garage-Guidelines"><em>Forrestal Garage Parking Guidelines</em></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://energy.gov/management/downloads/forrestal-garage-parking-procedures">Forrestal Garage Parking Procedures</a> (pdf), define policies and procedures governing the assignment, use, and management of parking spaces controlled by DOE in the Forrestal facility. Before applying for a parking permit please review the Order to be sure you meet the requirements to park in the Forrestal garage.</p>
<p><em>Obeying the "Stop" Signs!</em></p>
<p>We are concerned about employees who are not stopping at the posted “Stop” signs in the Forrestal Garage. We have the signs posted so that no one is hit, whether it be a pedestrian or vehicle. We have also noticed that some of the permit holders are not observing the posted speed limit in the garage. The posted speed limit is 5 mph. Their are permit holders that are driving through the garage doing up to 35 mph. The Federal Protective Service officers come in the garage and issue tickets to permit holders not adhering to the rules. They issue out tickets that are $50 and up, depending on the circumstance. Therefore, we ask that everyone observe the stop signs and speed limit in the garage so that we will not have any accidents.</p>
<p><em>Obey the Speed Limits!</em></p>
<p>The speed limit in the garage is 5 mph. Some of our customers are speeding through the garage as if the speed limit is 35 mph. The speed limit is there for your own protection whether walking to your car or driving. If a ticket is received from the Federal Protective Service, a monetary fine will be assessed and can only be appealed in Federal Traffic Court. Please drive carefully and responsibly.</p>
<p><em>Heed Directional Signs</em></p>
<p>It has been brought to the attention of the Parking Management Office that permit holders are not heeding the posted directional signs in the garage. The garage only has one lane and vehicles are to be driven in one direction. It has been reported that people are exiting the garage from their lane and going immediately up the ramp. But they are driving in the opposite direction of the posted directional signs to avoid having to drive around the garage when necessary. According to the <a href="https://energy.gov/management/downloads/forrestal-garage-parking-procedures">Forrestal Garage Parking Procedures</a> (pdf), Parking/Traffic Operating Procedures, DOE employees issued parking permits must park their vehicles in accordance with the procedures established in this Order and those instructions that may be given by the parking attendant. Employees will comply with all posted directional signs and observe safety and traffic regulations while operating a vehicle at the parking facility. Moreover, it is expected that drivers will be courteous to other drivers, pedestrians, and attendants. The Parking Committee may suspend for 1 month the permit of individuals who fail to follow directions provided by the parking attendants.</p>
<p><em>Departure Procedures</em></p>
<p>As stated in the <a href="https://energy.gov/management/downloads/forrestal-garage-parking-procedures">Forrestal Garage Parking Procedures</a> (pdf), "At the end of the workday, all vehicles must be moved by the posted lane departure time. Employees who fail to move their vehicles within 15 minutes of the posted departure times or when asked to do so by another employee will receive a violation notice and may be towed; parking privileges for such employees may be suspended and/or terminated.”</p>
<p>Permit holders who are blocked may call the permit holder blocking them and ask that they move their vehicle in order that they may leave the garage. If the vehicle has not been moved within 15 minutes of the posted lane departure time, notify an attendant so that the vehicle may be ticketed. If an attendant is not available take down the appropriate information and turn it into the Parking Management Office the next day - a ticket will be issued.</p>
<p><em>Guidelines for Leaving Early</em></p>
<p>Pursuant to the <a href="https://energy.gov/management/downloads/forrestal-garage-parking-procedures">Forrestal Garage Parking Procedures</a> (pdf), Employees who intend to leave during the workday should park in lanes designated for such access and egress if available. If such parking is not available, a parking attendant should be asked to provide assistance.</p>
<p><em>What To Do When Issued A Ticket</em></p>
<p>If you receive a ticket and want to appeal it, these are the steps to take. You must write an appeal letter. You must provide detailed explanation of the circumstances surrounding the violation or suspension. The appeal letter should also include the ticket number and the permit number that the violation was written on. Send your appeal letter to the Parking Management Office, located at GG-031 or by email. The appeal letter will be reviewed by the Parking Committee. The Committee will decide on sustaining or waiving the violation. The Parking Committee meets once a month, near the end of the month. Appeals received after the Parking Committee meeting will be reviewed at the subsequent meeting. Notification of the judgment will be sent through inter-office mail. This appeal process is for the DOE Forrestal garage issued ticket only. Federal Protective Services issued tickets are to be appealed in Federal Court.</p>
<p><em>After Hours Parking</em></p>
<p>The Forrestal Parking Garage is available for parking for ALL DOE employees with a valid DOE badge after 5:00 pm on weekdays and all day on weekends and holidays. Prior to 5:00 pm on weekdays, only permit holders are allowed in the garage.</p>
<p><em>Permit Holders Responsibilities</em></p>
<p>The employee to whom the parking permit is issued (i.e., the principal member in a car pool or van pool) must ensure that all information on the parking permit application is accurate and current. Employees must submit a new application to the Parking Management Office within 15 calendar days to register any change in unusual hours or car pool membership. Permits may be canceled if employees fail to resubmit their application</p>
<p>Parking permits must be displayed on the driver's side of the dashboard. The parking permit must be fully and clearly visible and include the names and current office telephone numbers (not voice mail number) of all permit holders in the garage. Vehicles that do not display a monthly parking permit are subject to an irrevocable parking ticket issued by the Federal Protective Service and/or a notice of violation issued by the Parking Management Office.</p>
<p>DOE employees issued parking permits must park their vehicles in accordance with the procedures established in the <a href="https://energy.gov/management/downloads/forrestal-garage-parking-procedures">Forrestal Garage Parking Procedures</a> (pdf), those instructions may be given by the parking attendant. Employees will comply with all posted directional signs and observe safety and traffic regulations while operating a vehicle in the parking facility. It is expected that all drivers will be courteous to other drivers, pedestrians, and attendants. The Parking Committee may suspend for 1 month the permits of individuals who fail to follow directions provided by the parking attendants.</p>
<p>Any falsification or misrepresentation of the information furnished on a parking permit application will result in 1 year revocation of parking privileges for the first violation and permanent termination upon a second violation. In addition, employees may be subject to disciplinary action for such falsification or evasion. Suspended employees cannot join other car pools/ van pools while they are suspended.</p>
<p><em>Pop Up Barriers</em></p>
<p>Caution should be used when approaching vehicle entrances and exits to the Forrestal Building. Be sure you present your badge and clearly display your parking permit on the driver's side dashboard. Establish eye to eye contact with the security officer on duty. Gain the security officer's acknowledgment to halt or proceed and follow admittance and exit with caution.</p>
<p><em>Procedures for Reporting Damages</em></p>
<p>If a driver accidentally strikes another vehicle in the parking facility, the driver must stop and check for any damages to either vehicle. If the other vehicle is damaged, the driver must notify the owner/driver immediately. The driver must also provide pertinent information about the accident to the security office and the parking attendant on duty. The parking attendant will notify the Federal Protective Service and Headquarters Security Office. In the event the parking office is closed at the time of the accident, or the discovery of the accident, these notifications should be accomplished at the first opportunity when the parking office is open for business.</p>
<p><em>What To Do When On Travel</em></p>
<p>Many permit holders are required to travel around the country on official business. As a courtesy to our customers, the Forrestal garage is available for permit holders to park their car for the duration of their trip. The following are guidelines that you should take if you wish to leave your car in the Forrestal garage.</p>
<ul>
