<p><a name="Purpose" id="Purpose">Purpose</a>
<div>
<p>To establish Headquarters Procurement Services Policies and Operating Procedures for the use of the Government purchase card at Department of Energy (DOE) – Headquarters (HQ).  These Policies supplement the "<a href="https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/maprod/documents/AttachmentFlash_2010-58.pdf">Policy and Operating Procedures for Use of the GSA SmartPay Purchase Card</a>" by DOE Personnel.  Authority to use the purchase card at Headquarters is granted by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) within the Office of Headquarters Procurement Services, MA-64. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="Responsible" id="Responsible">Responsibilities</a>
<div>
<p>HQs Approving Official will:</p>
<p> Promptly sign and forward all cardholders’ Statements of Account, Dispute Forms, and supporting documents to the Energy Finance and Accounting Service Center (CF-11) no later than the 8th of each the month following receipt of Statement of Account.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="Personal Property" id="Personal Property">Personal Property Management and Property Accountability</a>
<div>
<p>The Definition of Property includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p><strong>Administratively Controlled Property</strong>:  Government personal property items that have an acquisition value from $300 to $4,999 and are not considered sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalized Personal Property</strong>: Any single item of nonexpendable Government personal property that is acquired at a cost of, or valued at, $25,000 or more and has an estimated service life of two years or more.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong>:  Any item of Government personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 up to $24,999 and having the potential for maintaining its integrity (i.e. not expendable due to use) as an item.</p>
<p><strong>Expendable Personal Property</strong>:  Materials and supplies that when put to use are consumed, lose their identity, or become an integral part of other Government personal property.</p>
<p><strong>Government Personal Property</strong>:  Government-owned or Government-leased (from commercial sources) items of any kind (except real property or property related to real property) that are in the custody of DOE personnel or DOE contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Information Technology</strong>:  Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission or reception of data or information by the executive agency.  The term “information technology” includes computers, ancillary equipment, and software.</p>
<p><strong>Office Furnishings</strong>:  Articles that supplement office furniture and augment the utility of the space assigned.  These articles include lamps, desk trays, waste receptacles, draperies, carpets, and rugs.</p>
<p><strong>Office Furniture</strong>:  Items normally associated with the occupancy or use in such areas as offices, conference and reception rooms, institutional waiting rooms, lobbies, and libraries.  Such items include computer furniture, desk, tables, credenzas, bookcases, coat racks, telephone cabinets, filing sections and cabinets, security containers, chairs, and sofas.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive Property</strong>:  Items of Government personal property susceptible to being misappropriated for personal use or readily converted to cash (e.g., portable computers portable communications items, photographic items, firearms, survey instruments, binoculars, power tools, televisions, and video cassette recorders).</p>
<p><strong>Government Personal Property Tagging</strong>.</p>
<p>Government personal property must be tagged for accountability and control purposes at the time of receipt of the property.  All equipment and sensitive Government personal property will be assigned an individual identification tag number for tracking, inventorying, and disposal.  All administratively controlled Government personal property costing $300 or more will also be tagged for tracking purposes and disposal.  Personal property items costing less than $300 will not be assigned an individual identification tag number but will be identified as DOE property by using a special identification tag.  The identification tag will be a bar code, pressure-sensitive label and will be affixed to the item of Government personal property by a member of the asset management staff.  When it is deemed impractical to affix an identification number bar-code label because of the size or delicacy of the item, the identification number will be assigned, referencing the serial number of the item, and recorded in the official Government personal property database.  High-risk personal property will be identified and marked according to the DOE Property Management Regulations (PMR), Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and Chapter 109.</p>
<p>Furniture items will be tagged with bar-code tags indicating the national stock number (NSN) or locally assigned stock number assigned to the furniture item.  The NSN will be cataloged and entered into the Government personal property database.</p>
<p>   a. Personal Property Management</p>
<p>Property Management includes all functions necessary for the proper determination of need source, acquisition, receipt, accountability, utilization, maintenance, rehabilitation, storage, distribution and disposal of property.</p>
<p>   (1) DOE HQ maintains a personal property management program to maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for all property under its control. A critical element of the personal property management program involves the acquisition and receipt of needed items and the recording of the transaction on the formal accountable records of the Department.  The acquisition of personal property can be accomplished by a number of methods, including purchase card purchases.</p>
<p> (2) In all acquisitions of personal property, after receiving the item, the physical property must be issued for use or placed into service and the documentation of receipt must be forwarded to the property management office. Generally, this responsibility lies with other than the end user of the property.  However, when the end user has acquired the personal property with a purchase and the property is picked up by or delivered directly to the cardholder, the cardholder becomes accountable for the property and assumes responsibility for ensuring that the property items are recorded in the property management system.</p>
<p>   b. Property Accountability</p>
<p>(1) Purchases Shipped or Delivered by the Vendor.  All<br />Personal property acquired by using the purchase card should generally be delivered to and processed by the receiving office (loading dock).  This will ensure inventory control identification, as appropriate and recording in the personal property management records.</p>
<p>(2)  Purchases Hand Carried by the Cardholder.  Personal property purchased and hand carried by the cardholder or delivered directly to the cardholder requires inventory control identification and recording in the personal property management records, as appropriate.  Immediately following the purchase of the personal property, the cardholder will advise the property management office in writing (i.e., via E-Mail or facsimile) requesting that the equipment/property be identified and recorded, as appropriate.  Written confirmation should include the following information:</p>
<p>   a. Cardholder name, office symbol, telephone number, building and room number;</p>
<p>   b. Brief description of the personal property;</p>
<p>   c. Model No. and Serial No. of the personal property;</p>
<p>   d. Receipt verification witness name, office symbol, telephone number, building and room number.<br /> <br /><strong>Receiving Procedures for Items Purchased with the Purchase Card for Forrestal Loading Dock, and Germantown Loading Dock</strong><br />     <br />The following practices and procedures, as set forth by the Personal Property and Supply Management, Office of Logistics and Facility Operations, Office of Administration, are effective November, 2007.  These procedures are being implemented to create a safe work environment, reduction of damage to equipment and increase work load efficiently.</p>
<p>      DOCUMENTATION AND RECEIPT<br />    <br />      Documentation is one of the most important aspects of the receiving process.  It is used to verify delivery of the ordered items. Therefore, the documentation generated by the card holder during the ordering process MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE APPROPRIATE RECEIVING OFFICE PRIOR TO DELIVERY.  The MA-433 Receiving Office points of contact, phone numbers and fax numbers are provided, as follows, for each location:<br />     <br />          o Forrestal Loading Dock   ATTN: David Rowe and Tremayne Joseph, MA-433<br />             Fax: (202) 586-6967       Phone: (202) 586-6928<br />     <br />          o Germantown Loading Dock   ATTN: James Onley, MA-433<br />             Fax: (301) 903-3790      Phone: (301) 903-5388<br />    <br />       Following are delivery addresses for the loading docks:<br />     <br />       U.S. Department of Energy <br />       Forrestal Building<br />       1000 Independence Ave., SW <br />       Washington, DC 20585 <br />    <br />       U.S. Department of Energy<br />       Germantown Building<br />       19901 Germantown Road<br />       Germantown, MD 20874<br /> <br />The documentation to be provided to the Receiving Office by the ordering office, consists of the Purchase Order, and Telephone Quote Worksheet, or equivalent, and must include:<br />    <br />       o  Name of vendor<br />       o  Description of commodity being purchased<br />       o  Quantity of commodity being purchased<br />       o  Cost of item(s) being purchased<br />       o  Appropriation data<br />       o  DOEC-Web or other Purchase Order Number<br />       o  Name of ordering office's point of contact<br />       o  Phone number of ordering office's point of contact<br />       o  Expected delivery date<br />       o  Warranty information<br />    </p>
<p>The Forrestal and Germantown loading docks must have prior notice of delivery for any item(s) ordered through the Purchase Card.  Deliveries made to the Forrestal and Germantown loading docks, which do not have supporting ordering documentation on file at the receiving location, may be rejected if the consignee does not provide the required information in advance.<br />    <br />In addition, due to space constraints at the Forrestal and Germantown loading docks, Acquisition Officers are required to limit delivery volumes to 25 single packages per every 3 days.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the ordering office check with the vendor on packaging methods prior to supplying the vendor with a delivery address (e.g., an order of five (5) computers may be packaged as 10 or 11 boxes; 5 computers, 5 monitors and a box of cables, etc.)<br />    <br />The Receiving Personnel will make an attempt to locate the ordering office for any order received and not documented at the time of delivery.  If documentation cannot be obtained, the delivery will be rejected.  The ordering office will have to make new delivery arrangements. <br />     <br />   TAGGING OF ACCOUNTABLE PROPERTY<br />    <br />Depending on the receiving location, the following procedures will be followed:<br />    <br />       FORRESTAL AND GERMANTOWN<br />    <br />The Forrestal and Germantown Receiving Offices will notify the appropriate Property Office staff of the delivery by providing the Property Office with a copy of the ordering documentation (telephone quote worksheet).  A "Date of Receipt" will be noted on the documentation by the Receiving Office.  The appropriate property office staff will prepare the documentation needed for tagging and will physically tag the property.</p>
<p>Once the property is tagged, the Receiving Office will be notified by the Property Office staff to proceed with delivery of the order.</p>
<p><a name="Additional Prohibitions" id="Additional Prohibitions">Additional Prohibitions and Restrictions</a>
<div>
<p>HQ Purchase cardholders are subject to the following additional restrictions and prohibitions.  The following are additional prohibited uses of the Purchase card:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Purchases of food, beverages and other entertainment except as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Official ethnic awareness events which have been delegated to the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, and the Office of Human Resources Management.</p>
<p>(b)Instances when the agency determines that a reception with refreshments would materially enhance the effectiveness of its incentive award ceremony.</p>
<p>(c) For conferences. A conference is defined as a meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium or event that involves attendee travel. The term conference also applies to training activities that are considered to be conferences under 5 CFR 410.404.</p>
<p>For each conference you sponsor or fund, in whole or in part for 30 or more attendees, you must maintain a record of the cost of each alternative conference site considered. You must consider at least three sites. You must make these records available for inspection by the Office of the Inspector General or other interested parties.<br />Appropriations are not available to purchase memento items for distribution to conference attendees as a remembrance of an event.</p>
<p>You can not use appropriated funds to pay for meals or refreshments for employees at their official duty stations.</p>
<p>When meals or light refreshments are furnished at nominal or no cost by the Government or are included in the registration fee the applicable M&amp;IE will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1) If meals are furnished the appropriate deduction from the M&amp;IE rate must be made.</p>
<p>2) If light refreshments are furnished, no deduction of the M&amp;IE allowance is required.</p>
<p>The majority of the conference attendees must be in a travel status in order for light refreshments to be provided at Government expense. If the majority are not, then the rule for the allowance of light refreshments does not apply. A light refreshment is intended only as a refresher, and not intended to serve as a meal. The serving of light refreshments for conference attendee during morning, afternoon and evening breaks is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5702. Light refreshments are defined to include, but not limited to coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins.</p>
<p>Agencies may not provide light refreshments to non-federal travelers unless there is a mechanism for them to pay the cost of providing such refreshments, such as a registration fee.</p>
<p>Breaks should last no longer than 30 minutes and take place between meeting sessions. You should clarify and agree in advance that coffee and pastries if appropriate are purchased by the gallon and dozen. Per person charges should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> HQ Cardholders may purchase audio and visual equipment; however, prior to purchase, approval is required from Mike Wolfe 202-586-8410.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> All IT equipment purchased or leased must be Energy Star compliant. Specifically, when acquiring microcomputers, monitors, printers, fax machines and copiers all equipment must be compliant with the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star requirements for energy efficiency (Executive Order 12845).</p>

<p><a name="Fin Proc" id="Fin Proc">Purchase Card Financial Procedures</a>
<div>
<p>The purpose of this part of the policies and procedures is to provide financial procedures for the cardholders and approving officials who have been delegated purchasing responsibilities under the Headquarters Purchase Card Program.  As Government employees, the cardholders and approving officials have a responsibility to adhere to the laws and regulations that govern the financial aspects of making purchases on behalf of the Government.  Specifically, it is the responsibility of the cardholders and approving officials to mitigate violations of the <a href="https://energy.gov/documents/Antideficiency_Act.pdf">Anti-Deficiency Act</a> by ensuring that obligations are recorded in the Department’s official standard accounting and reporting system (STARS) before goods and services are ordered.  Secondly, it is the responsibility of the cardholders and approving officials to reconcile their monthly statements in a timely manner so that the cost of goods and services purchased are recorded against the appropriate program funds in a timely manner.  These practices represent sound financial management and mitigate criticism by the Office of the Inspector General, and other oversight entities.</p>
<p>The actual authority to make purchases is issued by the Office of Headquarters Procurement Services in the form of delegation letters.  The Energy Finance and Accounting Service Center (EFASC) has documented procedures to assist Headquarters cardholders and approving officials in carrying out their financial responsibilities when making purchases under the Purchase Card Program. </p>
<p>Funds must be obligated in STARS <strong>before</strong> placing orders for goods or services from a vendor.  This is necessary to ensure that the funds are available to make the purchase and to avoid violation of the Anti Deficiency Act.  The obligation of funds can be achieved by the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Strategic Integrated Procurement Enterprise System (STRIPES);</li>
<li>On a Transaction Basis; or</li>
<li>Bulk Reservation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purchases made in STRIPES</strong> – Obligations will be recorded when transactions are passed from STRIPES to STARS via an electronic interface process.  STRIPES will assign a purchase order number to each order. The interface will convert this number to a STARS purchase order number when the obligation is made in STARS.</p>
<p>How can the cardholder determine if the funds are obligated in STARS?  - When the funds are obligated in STARS, the interface process will cause the staus in STRIPES to change from “Pending Financial Approval” to “Released.”  Within two business days following the entry of the purchase into STRIPES, the program office can also generate a report from the Integrated Data Warehouse (IDW) to determine whether the obligation was successfully made in STARS.  For more information regarding the IDW, contact the I-MANAGE helpline at 301-903-2500, or visit <a href="https://idw.energy.gov/">https://idw.energy.gov/</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Obligating Funds on a Transaction Basis </strong>– The cardholder will use the respective MIADCC_ _ _ (or M6ADCC) purchase order number that has been assigned to him/her to make for use with the purchase card.  Requests to have funds obligated under the MIADCC purchase order number must be sent to:</p>
<p>Mail Stop: EFASC, CF-11<br />GTN/C-248<br />Attention:  Payroll and Budget Execution Team, or<br />E-mail:  Send PDF copy to: <a href="mailto:HQVendorPay@hq.doe.gov">HQVendorPay@hq.doe.gov</a></p>
<p>The obligation transaction in STARS is assigned a Line, Shipment, and Distribution designation (L/S/D), also referred to as a certification of funds availability (CFA) number.  Example:  L1, S1, D2.  These designations become a critical component in reconciling your BOA purchase card statement in Step 3 below.</p>
<p>How can the cardholder determine if the funds are obligated in STARS?  - EFASC will E-mail the cardholder and other designated program official that the obligation is made and send the L/S/D as confirmation.  The program office could also generate a report from the IDW.</p>
<p><strong>Note on Authority to Approve Obligations</strong>:  All program officials authorized to approve obligations must have a current Travel Authorization and Program Manager Signature card (<a href="https://energy.gov/documents/HQ_F_1500_5.pdf">HQ F 1500.5 09-05</a>) on file with CF-10.  Fillable forms are available at: <a href="http://www.directives.doe.gov/forms/0000.html">http://www.directives.doe.gov/forms/0000.html</a>.  CF-10 point of contact for signature cards:</p>
<p>Sharll Hane<br />Office of Finance and Accounting, CF-10<br />GTN/D-211<br />301-903-5887<br /><a href="mailto:Sharll.hane@hq.doe.gov">Sharll.hane@hq.doe.gov</a></p>
<p><strong>How to Obtain MIADCC Purchase Order Number</strong> – The cardholder should send a request to <a href="mailto:HQ_ACCT_Purchase_Card@hq.doe.gov">HQ_ACCT_Purchase_Card@hq.doe.gov</a> to obtain a MIADCC _ _ _ purchase order number once he/she has received a delegation of authority from Procurement.  EFASC will provide one-on-one training to cardholders covering the monthly reconciliation process before the purchase order number is issued.</p>
<p><strong>Bulk Reservation and Obligation of Funds - </strong>Bulk funding is a system whereby the contracting officer receives authorization from a fiscal and accounting officer to obligate funds on purchase documents against a specified lump sum of funds reserved for the purpose for a specified period of time rather than obtaining individual obligational authority on each purchase document.  Bulk funding is particularly appropriate if numerous purchases using the same type of funds are to be made during a given period.</p>
<p>Bulk funding may be requested for the acquisition of supplies/goods, however, bulk funding is not permissible for the acquisition of services unless the merchant is identified at the time of the obligation.  This is necessary due to IRS 1099 reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Cardholders can request a bulk reservation of funds by sending an obligation memorandum to EFASC, CF-11.</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong> – Obligations will be recorded when transactions are passed from CHRIS to STARS via an electronic interface process.  CHRIS will assign a purchase order number to the training request.  Example: TR8WA9999.  The training records in CHRIS must have a status of ENROLLED in order for the interface to process the obligation in STARS.  The obligation in STARS will be recorded under the purchase order number created in CHRIS.</p>
<p>How can the cardholder determine if the funds are obligated in STARS?  - Within two to three business days following entry of the training authorization into CHRIS, the program office can generate a report from the Integrated Data Warehouse (IDW) to determine whether the obligation was successfully made in STARS.  For more information regarding the IDW, contact the I-MANAGE helpline at 301-903-2500, or visit <a href="https://idw.energy.gov/">https://idw.energy.gov/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Unpaid/Uncosted Obligation Balances</strong> – Cardholders should periodically review obligation balances under their purchase order number MIADCC and DOE/C-Web purchases to verify whether unpaid/uncosted balances should be de-obligated.  Requests to have remaining funds de-obligated should be sent to:</p>
<p>Mail Stop: EFASC, CF-11<br />GTN/C-248<br />Attention:  Payroll and Budget Execution Team, or<br />E-mail:  Send PDF copy to: <a href="mailto:HQVendorPay@hq.doe.gov">HQVendorPay@hq.doe.gov</a> <br /> </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The JP Morgan Chase billing cycle ends the 27th of each month.  On the 28th of the month, each cardholder can and <strong>should</strong> access his/her monthly statement by logging onto <a href="../../../../exit@url=https%253A%252F%252Fgov1.paymentnet.com%252F.html" rel="nofollow">https://gov1.paymentnet.com/</a> .  It is <strong>preferable</strong> that all cardholders download their statements electronically instead of waiting for the mailed statement so that they have plenty of time to reconcile the statement and submit to EFASC by the 8th of the month following the end of the billing cycle.  Example:  The October billing cycle will end on October 27th.  The cardholder must submit his/her reconciled October statement to EFASC by November 8th for processing.<br /> </li>
<li>The cardholder’s reconciliation process will include matching each line item on the purchase card statement to the obligation created.  The cardholder will annotate the purchase order number (STARS term that replaced DISCAS CID) and appropriate accounting codes for each line item on his/her purchase card statement to show where the costs and payments are to be applied.  This procedure also applies to credits that are received on the purchase card statement.

<p><a name="Temps" id="Temps">Use of Private Sector Temporaries</a>
<div>
<p>A temporary help service firm is a private sector entity which quickly provides other organizations with specific services performed by its pool of employees, possessing the appropriate work skills, for brief or intermittent periods.  The firm is the legally responsible employer and maintains that relationship during the time its employees are assigned to a client. </p>
<p>Private sector temporaries or outside temporaries are those employees of a temporary help service firm who are supervised and paid by that firm and whom that firm assigns to various client organizations who have contracted for the temporary use of their skills when required.</p>
<p>• Private sector temporaries may be acquired using the Government purchase card under the provisions of 5 CFR Chapter 1, Subpart E.  Regulatory coverage is also set forth in 60 FR 46780, September 8, 1995.</p>
<p>• The regulations allowing use of private sector temporaries apply to competitive service and to Schedule A and B in the excepted service.  The regulations may not be used to acquire private sector temporaries for the Senior Executive Service or work of managerial or supervisory positions.</p>
<p>• The cardholder is authorized to order the use of private sector temporaries when one of the following short term situations exist:</p>
<p>An employee is absent for a temporary period because of a personal need including emergency, accident, illness, parental or family responsibilities, or mandatory jury service, but not including vacations or other circumstances not shown to be compelling; or</p>
<p>An agency must carry out work for a temporary period which cannot be delayed because of a critical need.  The need cannot be met with current employees or through the direct appointment of temporary employees within the time available by the date and the duration of time help is needed.  This determination shall be made in writing and at a minimum must state (1) there are no qualified candidates on the applicants supply file and on the reemployment priority list, (2) there are no qualified disabled veterans with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more who are immediately available for temporary appointment for the duration required, and (3) that employees cannot be reassigned or detailed without causing undue delay in their regular work.</p>
<p> The following requirements shall be observed:</p>
<p>• A cardholder may use a temporary help service firm in a single situation initially for no more than 120 workdays.  Provided the situation continues to exist beyond the initial 120 workdays, the cardholder may extend its use of temporary help services up to the maximum limit of 240 workdays.</p>
<p>• An individual employee of any temporary help firm may work at a major organizational element of an agency for up to 120 workdays in 24 month period.  The 24-month period begins on the first day of assignment.  An agency may make an exception for an individual to work up to a maximum of 240 workdays in a 24 month period only when the agency has determined that using the service of the same individual for the same situation will prevent significant delay.</p>
<p>• Approving Officials are required to maintain records and provide oversight to establish that their use of temporary help service firms is consistent with these requirements.  The Office of Personnel Management may require agencies to provide information on their use of temporary help service firms. </p>
