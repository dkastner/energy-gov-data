<p><strong>January 9, 2002</strong><br />Against a backdrop of futuristic vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show, Secretary Abraham and executives of Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announce a new cooperative automotive research partnership between DOE and the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR). The new research program supercedes the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). Secretary Abraham states that the new program, called FreedomCar, will "promote the development of hydrogen as a primary fuel for cars and trucks." He adds that the program will "fund research into advanced, efficient fuel cell technology which uses hydrogen to power automobiles.</p>
<p><strong>January 9, 2002</strong><br />DOE and Department of Defense officials brief reporters on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), a year-long study outlining nuclear force needs over the next five to ten years. From the current number of about 6,000 operationally deployed nuclear warheads, the NPR envisions an eventual level of from 1,700 to 2,200 weapons. Agency officials note that the NPR makes no recommendations about developing new nuclear weapons, but there will be a need to "establish and recover production capabilities" within DOE's nuclear weapons complex in order to be able to refurbish elements of the stockpile later in the decade. While the Bush Administration opposes ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the officials observe, "we continue to adhere to a test moratorium." At the same time, they indicate, the NPR stresses the "need to improve our readiness posture to test from its current two to three year period to something substantially better."</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2002</strong><br />As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, Secretary Abraham notifies Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn and the Nevada Legislature that he intends to recommend to President Bush that the Yucca Mountain site is scientifically sound and suitable for development as the nation's long-term geological repository for nuclear waste. The Secretary notes that there are "compelling national interests that require us to complete the siting process and move forward with the development of a repository."</p>
<p><strong>January 15, 2002</strong><br />Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Domestic Policy Vicky Bailey states that the "bookends" of California's energy crisis and the Enron bankruptcy could delay electricity deregulation for several years but would not be its "death knell." Congress has been considering electricity deregulation legislation but has yet to vote on it.</p>
<p><strong>January 17, 2002</strong><br />The Department announces that it is committing an additional $12 million to operations at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, N.M., increasing shipments of transuranic waste and benefiting the continued cleanup at the DOE's Idaho and Colorado sites. The additional funds will allow DOE to increase the total weekly shipments to WIPP by nearly 50 percent beginning in May.</p>
<p><strong>January 22, 2002</strong><br />The Department opens the bidding process for industry to exchange up to 22 million barrels of Federal "royalty oil" for oil that will be added to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is the first stage of President Bush's decision to fill the nation's emergency crude oil stockpile announced in November.</p>
<p><strong>January 23, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham announces that DOE will dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus weapons grade plutonium by turning the material into mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for use in nuclear reactors. The decision follows an exhaustive Administration review of non-proliferation programs, including alternative technologies to dispose of surplus plutonium to meet the non-proliferation goals agreed to by the United States and Russia in September 2000. DOE examined more than 40 disposition alternatives that considered costs, workable technologies, national defense requirements, and compliance with nuclear non-proliferation agreements. Previously, the government endorsed a dual-track approach to dispose of the plutonium including turning some of the material into MOX reactor fuel and immobilizing the remaining plutonium in self-protecting radioactive glass logs for long-term storage. Eliminating immobilization from the disposition pathway saves nearly $2 billion in funding, decreases plutonium storage costs, and facilitates the closure of DOE's former Nuclear Weapons Complex sites.</p>
<p><strong>January 28, 2002</strong><br />The Department's High Energy Physics Advisory Panel approves a subgroup's draft long-range planning report recommending support for a high-energy, high-luminosity, electron-positron linear collider, preferably to be constructed within the United States. The 800-1000 billion electron volts (GeV) machine would began operation at 500 GeV. If built onshore, the U.S. would contribute an estimated two-thirds of the total project cost of $5 to $7 billion for the initial stage. Among the potential discoveries using the proposed machine are new space-time and/or quantum dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>January 30, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham announces nuclear nonproliferation project with the Republic of Kazakhstan and private U.S. industry. Under the project, a former nuclear weapons plant in Kazahkstan will develop its capability to separate low-enriched uranium from uranium concentrates with assistance from two private U.S. companies and DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory. The uranium will then be made available as a power source to civilian power reactors throughout the world.</p>
<p><a name="feb" id="feb"><strong>January 31, 2002</strong></a><br />Following a "top-to-bottom" review of the Department's environmental management program, Secretary Abraham previews DOE's new accelerated cleanup plan for the sites of former nuclear weapon plants. The plan creates a new $800 million "Expedited Cleanup Account." To have access to these funds, a site and DOE must reach an agreement on an expedited schedule that shows measurable gains in addressing cleanup and important risks. A site that agrees to participate in the new expedited cleanup plan will receive more resources in the near term than in previous years. "By cleaning up serious problems more quickly under the new plan, our communities will be cleaner and safer," the Secretary notes. "And there is an extra benefit to the taxpayers, because over the long run, the new plan will yield substantial savings on overhead, maintenance and security costs."</p>

<p><strong>February 4, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham releases DOE's Fiscal Year 2003 budget request to Congress, calling it a blueprint to "build a stronger foundation for energy security in the 21st century." The $21.9 billion request is an increase of over $580 million, or 2.7 percent, from the 2002 budget. Of DOE's four "business lines," the National Nuclear Security Administration is $8 billion, up 5.7 percent from 2002; Energy programs are $2.4 billion, down 3.2 percent; Environment is $7.4 billion, up 2.3 percent; and Science programs are $3.3 billion, up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p><strong>February 7, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham and Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton call upon the Senate to immediately pass a comprehensive energy bill. "It is time for the Senate to pass an energy bill," Secretary Abraham states. "It is in our nation's interest - for the security of our nation's jobs and for the security of our nation's energy supply - that we unite to support swift passage of comprehensive energy legislation."</p>
<p><strong>February 7, 2002</strong><br />The Department and the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), an umbrella group for Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, agree on goals and timetables for the new FreedomCar program aimed at developing vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The agreement includes nine goals for developing specific technologies by 2010, including an electric propulsion system, a fuel cell power system, and hydrogen refueling and storage systems.</p>
<p><strong>February 8, 2002</strong><br />In an address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Secretary Abraham states that he does not have any "higher priority as Secretary than to significantly improve the reach and effectiveness" of the nation's nuclear nonproliferation programs. These programs, he notes, are "about preventing, detecting, and reversing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, while improving nuclear security worldwide."</p>
<p><strong>February 13, 2002</strong><br />As part of its Environmental Management Program review, DOE announces that 40 percent of the 70 Senior Executives in the Environmental Management (EM) program are being reassigned in order to "strengthen, streamline, and delayer" the leadership of the program. "The purpose of these reassignments is to better leverage the unique talents of these executives, force better integration between the field and headquarters of the real, on-the-ground challenges confronting the program, and to stimulate new thinking and creative solutions to our cleanup challenges," Assistant Secretary of Environmental Management Jessie Roberson states.</p>
<p><strong>February 14, 2002</strong><br />In an address before the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, President Bush announces the Clear Skies Initiative to cut power plant emissions and commits the nation to an aggressive strategy to cut greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years. The President states that his budget devotes $4.5 billion to addressing climate change, and he cites DOE's contribution of "$588 million towards the research and development of energy conservation technologies. . . . $408 million toward research and development on renewable energy."</p>
<p><strong>February 14, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham formally recommends to President Bush that the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada be developed as the nation's first long-term geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste. "I have considered whether sound science supports the determination that the Yucca Mountain site is scientifically and technically suitable for the development of a repository," the Secretary informs the President. "I am convinced that it does. The results of this extensive investigation and the external technical reviews of this body of scientific work give me confidence for the conclusion, based on sound scientific principles, that a repository at Yucca Mountain will be able to protect the health and safety of the public when evaluated against the radiological protection standards adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency and implemented by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission." The Secretary also notes that there are "compelling national interests" that require development of a repository, including energy and national security, homeland security, nuclear nonproliferation policy, secure disposal of nuclear waste, and ongoing efforts to clean up the environment at former nuclear weapons production sites.</p>
<p><strong>February 15, 2002</strong><br />President Bush notifies Congress that he considers Yucca Mountain qualified for a construction permit application. The President urges Congress to "undertake any necessary legislative action on this recommendation in an expedited and bipartisan fashion."</p>
<p><strong>February 15, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham unveils the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative aimed at building new nuclear power plants in the United States before the end of the decade. DOE proposes to invest $38.5 million in FY 2003 as part of a multi-year program to partner with the private sector to explore both federal and private sites that could host new nuclear plants; to demonstrate the efficiency and timeliness of key Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing processes designed to make licensing of new plants more efficient, effective and predictable; and to conduct research needed to make the safest and most efficient nuclear plant technologies available. The Secretary announce awards to two nuclear utilities, Exelon and Dominion Resources, to conduct initial studies of several sites that could eventually host new nuclear power plants. Both privately-owned sites and DOE's own Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Savannah River Site in South Carolina (SRS), and the Portsmouth site in Ohio will be considered in the site selection process.</p>
<p><strong>February 15, 2002</strong><br />Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-South Dakota) brings the energy bill to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>February 22, 2002</strong><br />The General Accounting Office files suit against the Bush Administration to obtain records of the energy panel chaired by Vice President Cheney.</p>
<p><strong>February 23, 2002</strong><br />In his weekly radio address, President Bush promotes his energy plan and passage of the energy bill by the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>February 25, 2002</strong><br />In remarks from the South Lawn of the White House, with Secretary Abraham and EPA Administrator Christie Todd Whitman in attendance, President Bush emphasizes the benefits of energy efficiency through technology and urges the Senate to act on the energy bill</p>
<p><strong>February 25, 2002</strong><br />In a report to Congress, Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and Administrator of DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration John Gordon announces the decision to eliminate a layer in NNSA's field management and streamline the operation of the nation's nuclear weapons complex.</p>
<p><a name="mar" id="mar"><strong>February 27, 2002</strong></a><br />In the Natural Resources Defense Council's suit to force DOE to produce documents relating to the Bush Administration's energy panel, a Federal court orders DOE to turn over most of the documents by March 25.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../../energygov.html">Top</a> of page</p>
<p><strong>March 4, 2002</strong><br />The Department releases a solicitation offering $330 million in Federal matching funds for industry proposed clean coal technology projects. The solicitation is the first competitive stage of President Bush's $2 billion, 10-year clean coal technology initiative.</p>
<p><strong>March 4, 2002</strong><br />Researchers at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and two other research facilities using a tabletop system report results that suggest the possibility of nuclear fusion reactions during the explosive collapse of bubbles in liquid. ORNL officials state that the results suggest the need for additional experiments.</p>
<p><strong>March 6, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham announces that DOE, EPA, and the State of Washington have agreed to accelerate cleanup of the DOE's Hanford operations. Under the plan, the parties will work to complete cleanup operations at Hanford 35 to 45 years sooner than the current estimated completion date of 2070. This is the first agreement reached under DOE's new Environmental Management Accelerated Cleanup Program. Funding requests for environmental management activities at the Hanford site will increase by $433 million as details of the accelerated cleanup plan are finalized, bringing the total budget request to more than $2 billion in Fiscal Year 2003 for the Hanford Site.</p>
<p><strong>March 6, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham tells the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development that DOE's FreedomCar program could help create a mass market for hydrogen-fueled vehicles by 2035.</p>
<p><strong>March 8, 2002</strong><br />President Bush signs the economic stimulus bill that includes several tax credits that benefit energy producers and consumers. These include an estimated $1 billion tax credit for power generators producing electricity from renewable sources and about a $150 million tax credit for consumers purchasing electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>March 12, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham signs an an Implementing Agreement today with the Uzbek Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdulaziz Kamilov, to facilitate cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation between the United States and Uzbekistan. As a result, the United States will begin work to repatriate to Russia highly enriched uranium fuel from a research reactor in Uzbekistan. The Uzbekistan government in turn has pledged to convert the reactor to use low-enriched uranium, the more proliferation-resistant form of reactor fuel. DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration will assist this conversion and aid Uzbekistan in the safe and secure storage of its nuclear materials.</p>
<p><strong>March 13, 2002</strong><br />The Senate strikes a provision of the energy bill that would increase fuel efficiency standards (known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy or CAFE standards) for cars, sport utility vehicles, and pickup trucks by 50 percent over 13 years. The Senate votes instead for an amendment that gives the Bush Administration two years to develop mileage rules.</p>
<p><strong>March 14, 2002</strong><br />Acting Director of DOE's Office of Science James Decker tells the joint DOE/National Science Foundation Nuclear Science Advisory Committee that the Laboratory Technology Research (LTR) program will be discontinued. The LTR program was set up in the early 1990s to promote technology transfer of energy innovations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) between DOE laboratories and private industry. The LTR program has been labeled "corporate welfare," Decker notes, and "Congress has whacked away at it over the years. It's become sub-critical in size."</p>
<p><a name="apr" id="apr"><strong>March 25, 2002</strong></a><br />The Department releases over 11,000 pages of information related to DOE's involvement with the National Energy Policy Development Task Force.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../../energygov.html">Top</a> of page</p>
<p><strong>April 8, 2002</strong><br />Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn vetoes President Bush's decision to proceed with the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the House and the Senate now have 90 legislative days to override Guinn's veto. If either the House or the Senate sustains the veto through a majority vote, construction at Yucca Mountain cannot go forward.</p>
<p><strong>April 9, 2002</strong><br />In response to world events, including increased tensions in the Middle East, Iraq's announcement that it will stop exporting oil, and labor problems in Venezuela, Secretary Abraham directs the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to produce its Energy Situation Analysis Report (ESAR) each weekday. The EIA produces the ESAR during emergency situations to monitor events that could cause disruptions in supplies stemming from volatile international situations. In the past, EIA produced the ESAR during Desert Shield/Desert Storm and during the Y2K transition, and has been producing it semi-weekly since October in response to the war on terrorism that resulted from the terrorist attacks on September 11.</p>
<p><strong>April 11, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham sends a letter to every member of Congress to update them on the circumstances affecting the oil and gas markets and the effect on prices. "Prices for crude oil have risen by over $7 per barrel since late February-an increase of over 30 percent-adding as much as 20 cents per gallon to the retail cost of gasoline," the Secretary tells the members of Congress. "Crude oil prices are rising because of global economic growth, OPEC production restraints, and concern over the current tensions in the Middle East and Venezuela." The Secretary notes that "the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects an average price of $1.46 for regular grade gasoline over the next six months. However, gasoline prices will peak somewhat higher in certain regions this summer."</p>
<p><strong>April 11, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham urges South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges to sign a proposed agreement to build a facility to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium by fabricating most of it into mixed oxide fuel (MOX) at DOE's Savannah River Site for use in commercial nuclear reactors. The agreement would ensure that the United States would keep its international nuclear nonproliferation commitments to the Russian Federation. In the proposal, DOE agrees to "maintain a pathway" out of South Carolina for any plutonium brought into the state. Governor Hodges calls the proposal acceptable but says he wants it guaranteed by a consent decree involving the Federal courts.</p>
<p><strong>April 12, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham calls Governor Hodges request for a consent decree "irresponsible" and inappropriate. "I hope that rather than electing to throw this matter into litigation, thereby vastly complicating its resolution," the Secretary tells Hodges, "you will reconsider, accept the proposal I have offered, [and] sign the proposed agreement which I believe gives you very substantial protection against a unilateral change of course."</p>

He notes that "whether it is fusion, a hydrogen economy, or ideas that we have not explored, I believe we need to leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that under any scenario requires a revolution in how we produce, deliver and use energy."</p>
<p><strong>November 12, 2002</strong><br />The Secretary also announces, in coordination with officials of the Departments of Transportation and Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as industry executives, an expanded 21st Century Truck Partnership. "Our goal is to dramatically improve the energy efficiency and safety of trucks and buses, while maintaining a dedicated concern for the environment," the Secretary says. The partnership will center on advanced combustion engines and heavy hybrid drives that can use renewable fuels.</p>
<p><strong>November 13, 2002</strong><br />The comprehensive energy bill dies in the conference committee as Senate negotiators conclude that time is too short in the few weeks remaining in the "lame duck" session to work out an agreement.</p>
<p><strong>November 13, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed El Baradei meet at DOE Headquarters in Washington, D.C., to discuss joint cooperation between DOE and IAEA on continuing nuclear nonproliferation efforts and other initiatives. At a joint press conference following the meeting, they announce that the U.S., Russia, and IAEA will sponsor a three-day international conference on radiological dispersal devices, or "dirty bombs," in March 2003 in Vienna, Austria.</p>
<p><strong>November 15, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham announces that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached 592 million barrels. Full capacity is 700 million barrels.</p>
<p><strong>November 15, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Argonne National Laboratory, located outside Chicago, Illinois, dedicates the Advanced Power-train Research Facility, the nation's only independent testing facility for engines, fuel cells, electric drives, and energy storage. State-of-the art performance and emissions measurement equipment at the facility is designed to enhance the development of advance technology powertrain components for cars and trucks, support model development, and validate advanced vehicle technology.</p>
<p><strong>November 19, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham announces that International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) has been awarded a $290 million, multi-year contract to build the two fastest supercomputers in the world. Named "Purple" and "BlueGene/L," the two systems will be part of the National Nuclear Security Administration's Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASCI) program for the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program and will be housed at DOE's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The Secretary notes that "ASCI Purple and BlueGene/L promise to deliver cost-effective, tremendous capability to the Stockpile Stewardship Program's critical mission to assess and certify the safety, security, and reliability of our nation's nuclear deterrent without underground nuclear testing."</p>
<p><strong>November 19, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Hanford Site in Washington State successfully moves the final shipment of spent nuclear fuel from the 324 Building to safe storage in the Canister Storage Building. The fuel was remotely loaded into a NAC-1 cask in a large airlock radiological control area. Next, the cask was pulled into a "Cask Handling Area" where it was checked by workers for leaks and welded shut for transport in a TC-104 steel container. The fuel collection from the 324 Building measures about 600,000 curies of radioactivity.</p>
<p><strong>November 20, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Agency (EIA), in a preview of its Annual Energy Outlook, projects that petroleum imports are expected to account for 68% of total petroleum demand by 2025, up from the current 55%. Imports made up 42% of supply in 1990 and 37% in 1980. The average world oil price is projected to increase from $22.01 per barrel (2001 dollars) in 2001 to $26.57 per barrel by 2025, largely due to the impact of higher projected world oil demand. In nominal dollars, the average world oil price reaches $48.11 per barrel in 2025. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use are projected to increase from 1,559 to 2,237 million metric tons carbon equivalent between 2001 and 2025, an average annual increase of 1.5 percent. This projection does not include future policy actions that might be taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p><strong>November 22, 2002</strong><br />In a brief stop in St. Petersburg, Russia, President Bush meets with President Vladimir Putin, and the two leaders issue a joint statement on development of the U.S.-Russian energy dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>November 25, 2002</strong><br />President Bush signs the Homeland Security Act, establishing the new cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security, and announces his intention to nominate former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge as the department's first secretary. Several current DOE functions and responsibilities are to be transferred to the new agency. DOE's Office of Environmental Management will lose its Environmental Measurements Laboratory in New York City. The National Nuclear Security Administration's nuclear threat assessment and smuggling program will be moved to Homeland Security, as will programs dealing with chemical and biological research connected to nonproliferation and activities related to microbial pathogens. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's advanced scientific computing research program is to be transferred, and, in the event of a national emergency, the authority to direct the Nuclear Incident Response program, also at Livermore, will now belong to the Secretary of Homeland Security. In addition, the new department is directed to enter into agreements with DOE to use the national laboratories to fulfill its mission.</p>
<p><strong>November 25, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham tours the University of Southern California's Doheny Eye Institute and announces that DOE will commit $9 million over three years to augment artificial retina research directed toward restoring vision to millions of people suffering from blindness.</p>
<p><strong>November 25, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory fires two security guards and places three employees accused of theft on paid administrative leave.</p>
<p><strong>November 26, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham uses remote control "scissors" to cut an electronic ribbon to dedicate the Molecular Environmental Science (MES) beamline at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source (ALS). The ALS is a synchrotron that accelerates electrons to energies of greater than 1.9 billion electron volts (GeV), focuses them into a tight beam, and sends this beam around the curved path of a storage ring for several hours. Beams of x-ray light can then be extracted and sent down beamlines to research instruments. The MES beamline will provide researchers with the ability to study environmental contaminants at the molecular level.</p>
<p><strong>November 26, 2002</strong><br />On a visit to DOE's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Secretary Abraham presents the Secretary's Gold Award-the Department's highest honorary award-to Dr. Edward Teller, Director Emeritus of LLNL, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to science and national security.</p>

<p><strong>December 4, 2002</strong><br />The U.S. Enrichment Corporation announces plans to demonstrate advanced gas centrifuge technology for uranium enrichment at DOE's Portsmouth, Ohio, facility. Following satisfactory demonstration of the technology, a future full-scale uranium enrichment plant will be located either at the Portsmouth site or at DOE's Paducah, Kentucky, facility.</p>
<p><strong>December 9, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory creates the Center for Homeland Security to serve as the key contact point at the laboratory for organizations seeking scientific and technical assistance in areas related to homeland security.</p>
<p><strong>December 10, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory creates the Homeland Security Organization to pull together laboratory scientists into teams to tackle homeland security problems.</p>
<p><strong>December 12, 2002</strong><br />A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative law judge finds that wholesale power suppliers overcharged the State of California by $1.8 billion from October 2000 through June 2001. The decision must be approved by the full commission.</p>
<p><strong>December 12, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham, in a ceremony at Santa Fe Indian School in New Mexico, announces that DOE has entered into agreement with the Pueblo Indians of San Ildefonso and the County of Los Alamos to transfer over 2,200 acres of federal land. More than 2,100 acres are being transferred to the Pueblo of San Ildefonso for use in traditional tribal and cultural practices. Over 100 acres are being transferred to the county, including the site of the Manhattan Monument, several parcel by the airport, and more than 75 acres at White Rock.</p>
<p><strong>December 13, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham announces intent to extend Lockheed Martin Corporation's contract to manage and operate DOE's Sandia National Laboratories for five years noncompetitively, contingent upon successful negotiation of contract terms.</p>
<p><strong>December 16, 2002</strong><br />Secretary Abraham establishes a high-level Task Force on the Future of Science Programs at DOE. Operating as a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB), the task force will examine science and technology programs across the Department and consider future priorities for scientific research.</p>
<p><strong>December 17, 2002</strong><br />President Bush signs into law new pipeline safety rules requiring the testing within five years of the riskiest 50 percent of gas pipelines in high-consequence areas. Remaining pipelines are to be tested during the following five years. Pipelines will then have to be retested every seven years.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2002</strong><br />The Department renegotiates Strategic Petroleum Reserve delivery contracts with five oil companies, allowing them to defer December and January deliveries of more than 7 million barrels of crude. The move is in response to concerns about continued labor unrest in Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil producer. Sharply curtailed exports of oil there have pushed crude prices to a two-month high of more than $30 per barrel.</p>
<p><strong>December 19, 2002</strong><br />The Nuclear Regulatory Commission reverses a decision by its Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the potential for terrorism has to be taken into account when considering the environmental effects of proposed nuclear energy facilities. The board had ruled that claims could be made over the potential for terrorist attack against the proposed mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication plant at DOE's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Among the scenarios put forward was a suicidal air crash of a jumbo jet.</p>
<p><strong>December 19, 2002</strong><br />A DOE external review team finds "weaknesses" in the Los Alamos National Laboratory's purchase card program. The laboratory has become the subject of intense scrutiny as a number of questionable purchase card transactions have come to light.</p>
<p><strong>December 20, 2002</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) implements a new organizational structure that eliminates a layer of management and seeks to achieve a 20 percent reduction in federal personnel by the end of Fiscal Year 2004. Three operations offices-at Oakland, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque-will be eliminated, and site offices that oversee contractor operations will now report directly to headquarters. The Oakland office will close; the Nevada office will be reduced in size and concentrate on managing the Nevada Test Site; and the Albuquerque office will become an NNSA Service Center providing procurement, human resources, and other support services to the site offices.</p>
<p><strong>December 20, 2002</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Agency (EIA), in Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2001, reports that U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases in 2001 totaled 1,883 million metric tons carbon equivalent, 1.2 percent less than in 2000. The 1.2 percent decrease from 2000 to 2001 is the largest percentage annual decline in total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions during the 1990 to 2001 time frame. The EIA attributes the decline to a combination of factors: "a reduction in overall economic growth from 3.8 percent in 2000 to 0.3 percent in 2001; a 4.4-percent reduction in manufacturing output that lowered industrial emissions; warmer winter weather that decreased the demand for heating fuels; and a drop in electricity demand and coal-fired power generation that reduced emissions from electricity generation."</p>
<p><strong>December 20, 2002</strong>The Department and the State of Tennessee sign an agreement in principle to set aside approximately 3,000 acres on the northwest portion of DOE's Oak Ridge Reservation for conservation. The conservation easement is intended as a partial settlement of natural resource damages resulting from past research and nuclear weapons production activities in Oak Ridge.</p>
<p><strong>December 23, 2002</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration issues a Preliminary Notice of Violation to the University of California, contractor for the Los Alamos National Laboratory, for violations of nuclear safety rules and procedures involving the storage of nuclear waste materials.</p>
<p><strong>December 24, 2002</strong><br />In a letter to University of California President Richard Atkinson, Secretary Abraham states that the government holds the University accountable for its management of DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory. The existing situation reflects a "systemic management failure" at Los Alamos, the Secretary notes. "I expect the University to continue its efforts to ensure these failures are corrected." The Secretary assigns Deputy Secretary Kyle McSlarrow and Acting National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Linton Brooks to evaluate the University's operation of the Laboratory and report their results by April 30, 2003.</p>
<p><strong>December 29, 2002</strong><br />Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) urges the Bush Administration to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to head off possible supply problems and additional price hikes caused by continuing unrest in Venezuela. "New Yorkers are being socked with a triple whammy this winter: a soft economy, rising unemployment and higher gas and heating oil prices," Schumer notes. "Unfortunately, with the oil strike in Venezuela and continuing unrest in the Middle East, we might not see relief from high oil prices unless something is done quickly." Also calling for a SPR draw down is House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana).</p>
