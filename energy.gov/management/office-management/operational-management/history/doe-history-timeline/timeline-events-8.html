<p><strong>January 5, 2010</strong><br />The National Governors Association <a href="../../../../../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.nga.org%252Fcms%252Fhome%252Fnews-room%252Fnews-releases%252Fpage_2010%252Fcol2-content%252Fmain-content-list%252Ftitle_six-states-to-develop-comprehensive-action-plans-to-improve-energy-efficiency-of-existing-buildings.html" rel="nofollow">announces</a> that six states – Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin – have been selected to participate in a program to help states develop comprehensive action plans to improve energy efficiency of existing buildings. The program is funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) monies.</p>
<p><strong>January 6, 2010</strong><br />Secretary of Energy Steven Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-47-million-improve-efficiency-information-technology-and.html">announces</a> that DOE is awarding $47 million for 14 projects to support the development of new technologies that can improve energy efficiency in the information technology (IT) and communication technology sectors. The Recovery Act funding is for research, development, and demonstration projects in three subject areas: equipment and software, power supply chain, and cooling of equipment. The funding will be matched by more than $70 million in private industry funding.</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu is present as General Motors produces the first lithium-ion battery pack for the Chevrolet Volt at its new manufacturing facility in Brownstown, Michigan. Funded by $106 million in Recovery Act funding <a href="../../../../../articles/president-obama-announces-24-billion-grants-accelerate-manufacturing-and-deployment-next.html">announced</a> by DOE in August 2009, the plant was converted from an empty facility to a production-ready site in five months. The lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant is the first operated by a major automaker in the U.S. General Motors provided $43 million of the plant’s costs.</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/department-energy-announces-inaugural-arpa-e-energy-innovation-summit.html">announces</a> the inaugural "ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit" to take place March 1-3, 2010 at the Gaylord National Hotel &amp; Convention Center in Washington, DC.  The event, hosted by DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) and organized by the Clean Technology and Sustainable Industries Organization (CTSI), will serve as a forum for the nation's energy leaders to share ideas, collaborate, and identify key technology opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2010</strong><br /> The Department <a href="../../../../../articles/doe-announces-additional-energy-efficiency-enforcement-action-protect-consumers.html">announces</a> that it has entered into a Consent Decree with Haier America resolving an investigation into whether Haier violated DOE's energy efficiency standards.  The Department's investigation led Haier to determine that a parts defect caused certain freezers to consume more energy than represented to consumers and possibly violated DOE's energy efficiency standards and the ENERGY STAR® requirements for freezers.  The Consent Decree obligates Haier to notify affected consumers, repair defective units, and pay a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2010</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) <a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.07.10">recognize</a> the 25th anniversary of a joint program between NNSA and DoD that has contributed to the development of advanced technologies necessary to meet warfighting needs and improve non-nuclear munitions. The Department and DoD signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 1985 establishing the DoD/DOE Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP). In the 25 years since, the JMP has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities that play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the armed services.</p>
<p><strong>January 8, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/doe-announces-clean-energy-projects-low-carbon-communities-americas-initiative.html">announces</a> the selection of three initial projects under the Low-Carbon Communities of the Americas (LCCA)—a program launched in June 2009 to assist countries in Latin America with sustainable energy market transformation initiatives. Through the LCCA program, DOE invited countries to submit proposals for collaboration in areas including renewable energy development and building and industrial energy efficiency.  The Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, along with other National Laboratories, will be providing technical assistance to countries receiving support under the initiative. The projects involve creating an Energy Efficiency Center in Costa Rica, building low-carbon communities in the Caribbean, and initiating a wind project in Dominica.</p>
<p><strong>January 8, 2010</strong><br />President Barack Obama <a href="../../../../../articles/president-obama-awards-23-billion-new-clean-tech-manufacturing-jobs.html">announces</a> the <a href="../../../../../articles/president-obama-awards-23-billion-new-clean-tech-manufacturing-jobs.html">award</a> of $2.3 billion in Recovery Act Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits for 183 clean energy manufacturing projects in 43 states. The projects were competitively selected through a rigorous merit review process and the companies chosen say they will create more than 17,000 jobs. Projects selected for this tax credit generally must be placed in service by 2014, but approximately 30 percent of them will be completed in 2010. As part of a partnership between DOE and the Department of Treasury, the Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit authorizes Treasury to provide developers with an investment tax credit of 30 percent for facilities that manufacture particular types of energy equipment. Qualifying manufacturers will produce solar, wind, and geothermal energy equipment; fuel cells, microturbines, and batteries; electric cars; electric grids to support the transmission of renewable energy; energy conservation technologies; and equipment that captures and sequesters carbon dioxide or reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu, in Columbus, Indiana, <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-187-million-improve-vehicle-efficiency-heavy-duty-trucks-and.html">announces</a> the selection of nine projects totaling more than $187 million to improve fuel efficiency for heavy-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. The funding includes more than $100 million from the Recovery Act, with a private cost share of 50 percent, and will support nearly $375 million in total research, development and demonstration projects across the country. The nine winners have stated their projects will create over 500 jobs, primarily researchers, engineers, and managers who will develop the new technologies. By 2015, the projects expect to create over 6,000 jobs—many in manufacturing and assembly.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2010</strong><br />The Department <a href="../../../../../articles/doe-steps-lead-significant-increase-compliance-energy-efficiency-reporting-requirements.html">announces</a> that it has received certifications for over 600,000 residential appliances in 15 different product categories in response to DOE's enhanced energy efficiency enforcement efforts. The Department recently announced that manufacturers had until January 8, 2010m to submit correct energy use data before aggressive enforcement actions were taken. The certification data provided by 160 different manufacturers will allow DOE to review manufacturers' compliance with minimum energy efficiency standards and take action to ensure that products are delivering the energy and cost savings required by law.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2010</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.12.10">announces</a> the removal of the final 5.4 kilograms (11.9 pounds) of U.S.-origin highly enriched uranium (HEU) spent nuclear fuel from Turkey. The material–the last significant amount of HEU in Turkey–was removed and returned to the U.S. for storage at a secure nuclear facility.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2010</strong><br />The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/07-5083.pdf">rules</a> that the federal government cannot claim an “unavoidable delay” in its defense against electric utilities suing the government because DOE did not begin disposing of utility spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998 as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-nearly-80-million-investment-advanced-biofuels-research-and-fueling.html">announces</a> the investment of $78 million under the Recovery Act for advanced biofuels research and fueling infrastructure that will help support the development of a clean sustainable transportation sector. Two biofuels consortia will seek to break down critical barriers to the commercialization of algae-based and other advanced biofuels such as green aviation fuels, diesel, and gasoline that can be transported and sold using today's existing fueling infrastructure. The selected projects consist of leading scientists and engineers from universities, private industry, and government, and will facilitate sharing expertise and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2010</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.13.10">announces</a> that it recently completed the installation and successful startup of a new surveillance diagnostic tool that is capable of detecting aging defects on critical components in the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. In response to NNSA's need to implement cost effective, optimized inspection of nuclear components (also known as "surveillance transformation"), scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory teamed with NNSA's Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, to develop a new X-ray computed tomography (CT) system to image nuclear weapon components. The new CT scan will enhance NNSA's surveillance program by providing a precise non-destructive means for the detection of aging phenomena on nuclear weapon components for evaluation of potential impact, and to provide a basis for assuring a high level of confidence in their continued performance.</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2010</strong><br />The Department’s Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships program <a href="http://www.fossil.energy.gov/news/techlines/2010/10002-DOE_Publishes_Best_Practices_Manua.html">releases</a> a new manual to recommend best practices for public outreach and education for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage projects. The recommendations are based on lessons learned by DOE’s seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships during the first six years of the partnerships program. The manual, titled <a href="http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/carbon_seq/refshelf/BPM_PublicOutreach.pdf">Best Practices for Public Outreach and Education for Carbon Storage Projects</a>, is intended to assist project developers in understanding and applying best outreach practices for siting and operating CO2 storage projects.</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-69-early-career-scientists-receive-85-million-funding-support.html">announces</a> that 69 scientists from across the nation will receive up to $85 million in funding under the Recovery Act for five-year research grants as part of DOE's new <a href="http://science.energy.gov/early-career">Early Career Research Program</a>. The new effort is designed to bolster the nation's scientific workforce by providing support to exceptional researchers during the crucial early career years, when many scientists do their most formative work. Awardees were selected from a pool of 1,750 university- and national laboratory-based applicants. Selection was based on peer review by outside scientific experts.</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2010</strong><br />The Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.14.10a">announces</a> that it has successfully completed the recovery of two high-activity Cesium-137 devices from a warehouse located approximately 25 miles from Manhattan in Rahway, New Jersey. NNSA recovered these disused and unwanted irradiators as part of its Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI). The devices, which contained more than 3,000 curies of Cs-137 at the time of their recovery, were used for medical research during their useful life.</p>
<p><strong>January 15, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-more-37-million-next-generation-lighting.html">announces</a> more than $37 million in funding from the Recovery Act to support high-efficiency solid-state lighting projects. Solid-state lighting, which uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) instead of incandescent bulbs, has the potential to be ten times more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent lighting. The 17 projects selected include funding for solid-state lighting core research, product development, and domestic manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>January 15, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu, at a roundtable meeting with energy reporters, discusses loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants, the FutureGen project, increased funding for the development of high-performance computing, and the potential environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing to extract gas and oil from shale. The Department’s research efforts to develop hydraulic fracturing have provided a huge return on investment, the Secretary notes, with lower costs and reduced imports. “The return on investment could be a hundred fold, it could be a thousand fold,” says the Secretary. “We don't even know yet.”</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2010</strong><br />The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="../../../../../articles/us-district-court-upholds-does-action-against-lg-enforce-energy-star-requirements.html">upholds</a> the Department's decision to remove the ENERGY STAR® label from certain inefficient LG refrigerator-freezer models. As part of its expanded energy efficient enforcement efforts, DOE had taken steps over the past few months to remove the label from these products, which independent testing had shown were consuming significantly more energy than allowed by the ENERGY STAR® program. The Court's <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2009cv2297-25">Memorandum Opinion</a> denied LG's motion for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed the manufacturer to continue using the ENERGY STAR® label on approximately 40,000 affected LG refrigerator-freezers. Throughout the proceedings, DOE maintained the government's right to enforce the energy efficiency requirements associated with the ENERGY STAR® program.</p>
<p><strong>January 20, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/department-energy-invest-12-million-support-early-stage-solar-technologies.html">announces</a> that the Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will invest up to $12 million in total funding—$10 million from the Recovery Act—in four companies to support the development of early stage solar energy technologies and help them advance to full commercial scale. Companies awarded under DOE's Photovoltaic Incubator Program will work with NREL to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>January 20, 2010</strong><br />The Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2010/801.html">releases</a> the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/47078.pdf">Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study</a> indicating that the eastern U.S. could derive 20 percent of its electricity from wind power by 2024. The <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/wind/news/2010/803.html">two-and-a-half year technical study</a> of future high-penetration wind scenarios finds that transmission upgrades, offshore wind, and operational changes would be needed.</p>
<p><strong>January 21, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu, in <a href="../../../../../congressional/downloads/committee-energy-and-natural-resources-united-states-senate.html">testimony</a> before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, discusses clean energy research and development needed to meet the medium and long-term challenges associated with climate change.</p>
<p><strong>January 21, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-more-205-million-community-renewable-energy-deployment-projects.html">announces</a> the selection of five projects to receive more than $20.5 million from the Recovery Act to support deployment of community-based renewable energy projects, such as biomass, wind and solar installations. The projects will be leveraged with approximately $167 million in local government and private industry funding. The Department estimates that these projects will provide enough clean, renewable energy to displace the emissions of approximately 10,700 homes.</p>
<p><strong>January 21, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-closing-465-million-loan-tesla-motors.html">announces</a> that DOE has closed its $465 million loan with Tesla Motors, Inc., for construction of a manufacturing facility in southern California on the Model S electric sedan and a power-train manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto facility will assemble electric vehicle battery packs, electric motors, and related electric vehicle control equipment, both for Tesla's own electric vehicles and for sale to other automobile manufacturers. The agreement was negotiated and signed by DOE's Loan Programs Office. Tesla's planned Model S will consume no gasoline and will not produce any tailpipe emissions.

<p><strong>February 1, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/presidents-energy-budget-invests-innovation-clean-energy-and-national-security-priorities-0.html">details</a> President Obama's $28.4 billion <a href="http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/11budget/index.htm">Fiscal Year 2011 budget request</a> for DOE. The Secretary highlights the development of a clean energy economy; investment in advanced science, research, and innovation; maintenance of a strong nuclear deterrent and secure nuclear materials both at home and abroad, and improvements in energy efficiency to help curb greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. The FY 2011 budget request also places an emphasis on DOE improving fiscal performance with the proposed creation of a new initiative on Management Reform. An additional $36 billion—on top of the existing $18.5 billion—in loan guarantee authority for the near-term deployment of new nuclear power plants is requested. “In order to really restart the nuclear industry in the United States,” the Secretary told reporters, “you need several of each type of reactor.” Noting that three major reactor designs were currently under development, the Secretary said the total funding would be “enough to allow seven to ten reactors to be built.” The President’s 2011 budget contains no anticipated “climate revenue” from a climate cap-and-trade bill, unlike the 2010 budget request that forecast raising $646 billion over the next decade. “We don't have cap-and-trade legislation, so one doesn't plan a budget on something we don't have,” the Secretary observes. “The administration's position is that we would still very much like to have a cap on carbon that slowly ratchets down. We would like to have it so that this is the very important long-term signal, but largely it is going to be revenue-neutral, so that you return the proceeds from anything back to people who pay energy bills, to industries, to states, so that you give them time to make these adjustments.”</p>
<p><strong>February 2, 2010</strong><br />The Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="../../../../../articles/epa-and-doe-join-states-speed-energy-efficiency-progress-united-states.html">announce</a> the creation of the State Energy Efficiency (SEE) Action Network. The network is meant to help states achieve maximum cost effective energy efficiency improvements in homes, offices, buildings and industry by 2020. Through the Network, DOE, EPA and other member organizations will assist states with their energy efficiency initiatives, including residential efficiency programs, financing solutions, and improving availability of energy usage information.</p>

Noting that while he is “very firm” in his “conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy –solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal— that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy,” the U.S. is “going to need some of the old, traditional energy sources as we're developing these new ones and ramping them up.” The question is, the President says, “are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe, secure nuclear power; that includes new technologies so that we can use coal—which we have in abundance and is very cheap, but often is adding to our greenhouse gases—can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up; can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable?” He says he hopes his “Republican friends, but also Democrats, say to themselves, let's be practical and let's do both. . . . Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix. But we've got to do both.”</p>

<p><strong><a name="apr" id="apr"></a>March 31, 2010</strong><br />President Obama and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, with Secretary Chu in attendance, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-energy-security">announce</a> at Andrews Air Force Base that the administration will expand oil and gas development and exploration on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to enhance the nation’s energy independence while protecting fisheries, tourism, and places off U.S. coasts that are not appropriate for development. “I want to emphasize,” the President says in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-energy-security-andrews-air-force-base-3312010">remarks</a>, “that this announcement is part of a broader strategy that will move us from an economy that runs on fossil fuels and foreign oil to one that relies on homegrown fuels and clean energy. And the only way this transition will succeed is if it strengthens our economy in the short term and the long term. To fail to recognize this reality would be a mistake.” The President also states that the new fuel economy standards in cars and trucks announced on May 19, 2009, will be finalized on April 1. President Obama, in addition, <a href="../../../../../articles/gsa-doubles-federal-hybrid-fleet-doe-takes-lead-updating-hybrids.html">announces</a> that the federal government will lead by example in replacing older cars in the federal fleet with fuel efficient hybrids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The U.S. General Services Administration will replace 5,603 of the least fuel efficient cars and trucks in the federal fleet with fuel efficient hybrids, doubling the number of hybrids in the federal fleet without increasing the total number of vehicles. The Department is helping lead the way on this initiative by replacing 753 vehicles with hybrids in 2010. This will bring the total number of hybrid vehicles at DOE to 888, even as DOE begins to reduce the overall size of its vehicle fleet. The President notes that making the announcement at Andrews highlights that energy is a national security issue.</p>

<p><strong>May 25, 2010</strong><br />President Obama <a href="../../../../../articles/readout-president-obamas-call-secretary-chu.html">speaks</a> with Secretary Chu by telephone from Air Force One. The Secretary briefs the President on his scientific and technical assessment of BP's plans for a possible “top kill”—an effort to stop the flow of oil by injecting heavy drilling fluids into the well—and what the next steps will be if BP's "top kill" fails to stop to leak. The Secretary, who is in Houston, has been leading a team of top scientists who have been scrutinizing BP's plans to stop the leak and providing expert advice and ideas to help better inform BP's approach and maximize the chances for success. BP is now conducting crucial diagnostic pressure tests inside the blowout preventer before the "top kill" moves forward. The Secretary and his team are evaluating that data in real time as it is coming in. They are also helping analyze multiple backup plans if the "top kill" does not work.</p>

The leak, he notes, “has tested the limits of human technology,” which is why “just after the rig sank” he “assembled a team of our nation’s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge—a team led by Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nation’s Secretary of Energy. Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies,” the President says, “have also provided ideas and advice. As a result of these efforts, we’ve directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology. And in the coming weeks and days, these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well. This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that’s expected to stop the leak completely.” Noting that “we need better regulations, better safety standards, and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling,” the President asserts that the “larger lesson” is the “need to end America’s century-long addiction to fossil fuels.” He adds that this is not “some distant vision for America. The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time, but over the last year and a half, we’ve already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry. As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels. Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient. Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries.”</p>

<p><strong>October 13, 2010</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press348.cfm">releases</a> the October 2010 <em>Short-Term Energy Outlook</em> and forecasts a modest rise in heating bills for many U.S. consumers during the upcoming winter. "EIA expects household bills for space-heating fuels will be about 3 percent higher than a year ago, with the average household spending $986 in the October through March winter heating season, an increase of $24 from last winter," says EIA Administrator Richard Newell. The higher bills primarily reflect higher fuel prices, although expected colder weather than last winter in the Northeast will also contribute to more fuel use. EIA expects the largest increases in fuel expenses to be in households using propane and heating oil. Households using electricity for space heating, particularly in the South, should see lower average fuel bills, in part due to expected warmer weather. </p>

"I think there are a lot of Republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the House last year, " the President notes. "And so it’s doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the House this year or next year or the year after. But that doesn't mean there isn't agreement that we should have a better energy policy. And so let’s find those areas where we can agree. We’ve got, I think, broad agreement that we’ve got terrific natural gas resources in this country. Are we doing everything we can to develop those? There's a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric cars are developed here in the United States, that we don't fall behind other countries. Are there things that we can do to encourage that? And there's already been bipartisan interest on those issues. There's been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases. Is that an area where we can move forward? We were able, over the last two years, to increase for the first time in 30 years fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks. We didn’t even need legislation. We just needed the cooperation of automakers and autoworkers and investors and other shareholders.  And that's going to move us forward in a serious way. So I think when it comes to something like energy, what we’re probably going to have to do is say here are some areas where there's just too much disagreement between Democrats and Republicans, we can’t get this done right now, but let’s not wait. Let’s go ahead and start making some progress on the things that we do agree on, and we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those areas where we don’t."</p>

<p><strong>November 29, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu, in a <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-chinas-clean-energy-successes-represent-new-sputnik-moment-america.html">speech</a> at the National Press Club, says that the success of China and other countries in clean energy industries represents a new "Sputnik Moment" for the United States and requires a similar mobilization of America's innovation machine so that we can compete in the global race for the jobs of the future. "When it comes to innovation, Americans don't take a back seat to anyone - and we certainly won't start now," states the Secretary. "From wind power to nuclear reactors to high speed rail, China and other countries are moving aggressively to capture the lead. Given that challenge, and given the enormous economic opportunities in clean energy, it's time for America to do what we do best: innovate. As President Obama has said, we should not, cannot, and will not play for second place.”</p>
<p><strong>November 29, 2010</strong><br />The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a group of presidentially appointed experts from academia, non-governmental organizations, and industry, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-energy-release-final.pdf">releases</a> a report recommending that the U.S. craft a government-wide federal energy policy and update it regularly with strategic Quadrennial Reviews similar to those produced by the Department of Defense. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-energy-tech-report.pdf">report</a>, <em>Accelerating the Pace of Change in Energy Technologies Through an Integrated Federal Energy Policy</em>, provides a roadmap for the federal role in transforming the U.S. energy system within one to two decades—a transformation that is necessary, it concludes, for reasons of economic competitiveness, environmental stewardship, and national security. The report also finds that the Federal investment in energy-related research, development,<br />demonstration, and deployment (RDD&amp;D) is considerably less than in a number of other industrialized countries as a fraction of gross domestic product. It urges a substantial increase—to about $16 billion per year, from the current annual level of approximately $5 billion—and suggests that the President engage the private sector, consumer representatives, and Congress to explore options to provide about $10 billion of the additional funding through new revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>November 29, 2010</strong><br />The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/e77fdd4f5afd88a3852576b3005a604f/7792719880900f5e852577ea006e9ac9!OpenDocument">announces</a> that 13.95 billion gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuels will be blended into U.S. gasoline supplies in 2011. This is about 1 billion gallons more than the current renewable-fuels mandate. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 amended the Clean Air Act to increase the total required volume of renewable fuels each year, reaching a level of 36 billion gallons in 2022. The EPA finalizes a lower 2011 cellulosic biofuels volume, at 6.6 million gallons, than the statutory target due to slower than expected commercial availability. The EPA, however, "remains optimistic that the commercial availability of cellulosic biofuel will continue to grow in the years ahead." </p>
<p><strong>November 30, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu, during a <a href="../../../../../downloads/energy-race-our-new-sputnik-moment.html">live online chat</a> at the White House, <a href="../../../../../articles/secretary-chu-announces-nearly-21-million-technical-assistance-projects-improve-energy-use.html">announces</a> that 24 Recovery Act projects are receiving a total of $21 million in technical assistance to dramatically reduce the energy used in their commercial buildings. This initiative will connect commercial building owners and operators with multidisciplinary teams including researchers at DOE’s National Laboratories and private sector building experts. The teams will design, construct, measure, and test low-energy building plans, and will help accelerate the deployment of cost-effective energy-saving measures in commercial buildings across the U.S. The projects are funded with a public/private cost-sharing agreement, where the building owners and operators contribute at least 20 percent. Building owners and operators do not receive direct funding through the project, but instead get access to state-of-the-art technical guidance to implement energy efficiency technologies throughout the design, construction, and evaluation phases of their building and retrofit projects. This technical expertise includes energy modeling and energy performance verification by laboratory researchers and private sector experts. The Secretary also says that he would like to see the U.S. generate at least 20 percent of its electricity from renewable<br />sources by 2020, and 50 percent or more by 2050.</p>

"Absent a price on carbon," he notes, referring to the failure to pass a comprehensive bill that would have put a price on carbon emissions, "what are the things you can do? Well, you can create a demand for this thing, whether it be wind or solar or any form of renewable energy [and] say, ‘This is where we are heading,’" Asked to grade his work so far at DOE, the Secretary points to start up of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and obligating more than $32 billion in Recovery Act funds within DOE’s deadline of 18 months. "In those two things," he observes, "I would give, I would say, an ‘A’."</p>
<p><strong>December 13, 2010</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/gaz121310">announces</a> the successful removal of more than 3,900 radiological sources, the largest single radiological source consolidation to date in Ukraine, from the Electron Gaz Plant in Zholtiy Vodi, Ukraine. The sources, which were left behind after the company operating the plant went bankrupt, have now been transferred to a new, high-security facility dedicated by U.S. and Ukrainian officials earlier this year</p>
<p><strong>December 14, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/energy-department-completes-cool-roof-installation-dc-headquarters-building-save-money.html">announces</a> the completion of a new cool roof installation on the Department’s Headquarters West Building.  There was no incremental cost to adding the cool roof as part of the roof replacement project and it will save taxpayers $2,000 every year in building energy costs. Cool roofs use lighter-colored roofing surfaces or special coatings to reflect more of the sun's heat, helping improve building efficiency, reduce cooling costs, and offset carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>December 14, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../../../../../articles/department-energy-closes-400-million-loan-guarantee-state-art-solar-manufacturing-indiana.html">announces</a> that a $400 million loan guarantee has been finalized for Abound Solar Manufacturing, LLC, to manufacture state-of-the-art thin-film solar panels. The Abound Solar project represents the fifth Recovery Act loan guarantee project to close to date. The project, which includes facilities in Longmont, Colorado, and Tipton, Indiana, will use new manufacturing technology for Cadmium-Telluride panels that has never before been deployed commercially in the world. At full capacity, the project will be capable of producing 840 megawatts of solar panels each year.</p>
<p><strong>December 15, 2010</strong><br />The Department <a href="../../../../../articles/department-energy-releases-strategy-critical-materials.html">releases</a> a report, <em><a href="https://energy.gov/node/206101">Critical Materials Strategy</a></em>, examining the role of rare earth metals and other materials in the clean energy economy. The report concludes that several clean energy technologies—including wind turbines, electric vehicles, photovoltaic cells and fluorescent lighting—use materials at risk of supply disruptions in the short term. These risks are likely to decrease in the medium and long term. The report notes that of the materials analyzed, five rare earth metals (dysprosium, neodymium, terbium, europium and yttrium), as well as indium, are assessed as most critical in the short term.</p>
<p><strong>December 15, 2010</strong><br />Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-ag-1442.html">announces</a> that the Justice Department has filed a civil lawsuit against nine defendants, including BP, in the matter of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. <span lang="EN-CA" lang="EN-CA">In the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, the U.S. alleges violations of federal safety and operational regulations which caused or contributed to the oil spill that began on April 20, 2010, when an explosion and fire destroyed the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 50 miles from the Mississippi River delta.</span></p>
<p><strong>December 16, 2010</strong><br />Secretary Chu and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar <a href="../../../../../articles/salazar-chu-announce-next-step-nations-march-toward-renewable-energy-future.html">announce</a> a comprehensive environmental analysis that has identified proposed "solar energy zones" on public lands in <a href="http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/MINERALS__REALTY__AND_RESOURCE_PROTECTION_/energy/solar_and_wind.Par.57805.File.dat/DraftSolarPEISmaps.pdf">six western states</a> most suitable for environmentally sound, utility-scale solar energy production.
