<p><strong>January 3, 2005 </strong><br />The Delphi Corp., a partner in DOE's advanced fuel cell development program, reports that it has exceeded the power density level required to meet the government's $400 per kilowatt cost goal for fuel cells. Meeting the cost target is essential if fuel cells are to expand beyond their current niche markets into widespread commercial use. At $400 per kilowatt-nearly one-tenth the cost of power-generating fuel cells currently sold on the market-fuel cells would compete with traditional gas turbine and diesel electricity generators and become viable power suppliers for the transportation sector. The Department has set 2010 as the timeframe for low-cost fuel cells to be sufficiently developed for commercial markets.</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2005</strong><br />At the opening of the first session of the 109th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) both say passing energy legislation is a top priority. "There is work left undone from the last Congress, and we need to act on it," Frist notes. "America is long overdue for an energy policy." Hastert describes the "volatile energy market" as an "impediment to our continued economic prosperity."</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/us-department-energy-awards-paducah-remediation-contract-north-wind-paducah-cleanup-company.html" target="_self">awards</a> North Wind Paducah Cleanup Company LLC a $302 million small business contract to perform environmental remediation and waste management activities at the DOE's Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. "The Department of Energy is proud to support President Bush's Small Business Agenda by awarding large-scale cleanup contracts like this to small businesses," says Secretary Spencer Abraham.</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/us-department-energy-awards-portsmouth-remediation-contract-lataparallax.html" target="_self">awards</a> LATA-Parallax Portsmouth LLC, a small business joint venture between Los Alamos Technical Associates Inc. and Parallax Inc., a $141 million small business contract to perform environmental remediation and waste management activities at the DOE's Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2005 </strong><br />President Bush, in an interview by the Wall Street Journal, states that he is "looking forward to working with Congress on whether or not we can move forward on nuclear power. I believe nuclear power answers a lot of our issues. It certainly answers the environmental issue, and those people who are concerned about whether or not we can continue burning coal."</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2005 </strong><br />The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board's Nuclear Energy Task Force recommends that the federal government provide $3.6 billion in financial incentives to the first 12 power plants to be built under DOE's Nuclear Power 2010 program.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Abraham <a href="../articles/us-and-bahamian-governments-cooperate-detecting-illicit-shipments-nuclear-material.html" target="_self">announces</a> that the U.S. and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas recently signed an agreement to install specialized radiation detection equipment, originally developed by DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration laboratories, at one of the Bahamas' busiest seaports to detect hidden shipments of nuclear and other radioactive material. The Bahamas will be the first country in the Caribbean to deploy this type of detection system. "Helping better protect the world's maritime shipping network from nuclear smuggling is an important objective we are working to achieve," the Secretary says. "Successful detection of radioactive materials as they cross a country's borders is fundamental in stopping a nuclear or dirty bomb attack."</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Abraham, in a <a href="../articles/council-foreign-relations.html" target="_self">speech</a> to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., <a href="../articles/abraham-calls-global-community-aggressively-address-nuclear-nonproliferation.html" target="_self">calls</a> on the global community to join in implementing a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation strategy to address 21st century challenges. "The challenge of confronting terrorism falls to every nation," he notes. "A global threat demands global participation." The Secretary discusses four broad areas that need to be addressed for a workable nonproliferation strategy: 1) the U.S. must fund and finish programs, such as the Megaports initiative, that it has committed to doing; 2) the Russian government must increase its global leadership role; 3) other nations must increase involvement in confronting terrorist threats, and 4) the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty must be effective nonproliferation tools.</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Abraham, in his last scheduled public <a href="../articles/generation-iv-international-forum.html">speech</a> before the Generation IV International Forum, calls for an increased emphasis on nuclear energy. "It's time for rational people on all sides of the nuclear debate," he tells reporters after the speech, "to come together and attempt to find an acceptable way to ensure that the advantages of nuclear energy are part of our energy and environmental solutions." The Secretary notes that "of all the forms of emission-free energy available today, only nuclear power can deliver large blocks of dispatchable electricity regardless of the weather, time of day or geographic location."</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Abraham <a href="https://energy.gov/node/298183%22">announces</a> that DOE's 3rd annual "What's Next" Expo will be held in the Detroit area. The expo is part of DOE's Scientists Teaching And Reaching Students (STARS) science education initiative announced by Secretary Abraham in July 2004. The What's Next Expo is designed to showcase the newest, most innovative, cutting edge scientific and technological advances as a way to interest students in pursuing careers in math and science.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-exercises-5-year-option-washington-tru-solutions-contract-operate-wipp.html">announces</a> that it has decided to exercise the five year option in the Washington TRU Solutions LLC ("WTS") contract to continue managing and operating DOE's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), located in New Mexico. The option DOE exercised is a part of the WIPP contract that was competitively procured in 2000. The WTS contract will now run through September 30, 2010, with an estimated value over the five year timeframe of approximately $704 million.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, dedicates the Biomass Surface Characterization Laboratory, a $2.85 million facility featuring an array of electron and optical microscopes and other advanced research tools to probe biomass-to-energy processes at the most basic atomic and molecular levels. The facility will provide scientists with the tools to explore the chemical and biological reactions that can transform renewable plant and waste materials into useful sources of energy.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Abraham <a href="../articles/deputy-secretary-energy-kyle-mcslarrow-resigns.html">announces</a> the resignation of Deputy Secretary Kyle McSlarrow.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary of Energy-designate Samuel W. Bodman appears at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. "The Department of Energy, with its critical national and economic security missions," Secretary-designate Bodman says in his opening statement, "is one of our most important federal agencies. But, at the same time, it is perhaps one of the least understood by much of the general public. That lack of understanding might be partly a result of its name, which belies the broad spectrum of the department's scientific research and national defense missions." The Secretary-designate says that passage of an energy bill is among his top priorities. "Comprehensive energy legislation should address the energy challenges that we face, including high prices for gasoline, heating oil and natural gas, power blackouts and shortages in some regions of natural gas and electricity," he observes. "It is, in my view, among the most important matters to come before Congress." He also says that he would be "an energetic advocate" of oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Abraham, in a farewell session with reporters, notes his disappointment in failing to pass energy legislation. "I wish we could have finished the energy bill in the last Congress," he says. "We were so close. With the new numbers in the Senate this year, it will pass." Observing that "in the world of energy, things don't happen overnight," the Secretary states that an impediment to achieving significant change in energy policy is public indifference. "The magnitude of the questions," he says, "is not fully appreciated." The Secretary states that among the accomplishments he is "proudest of" are DOE's introduction of programs supporting "breakthrough new technologies" in carbon sequestration, clean coal, and hydrogen.</p>
<p><strong>January 20, 2005 </strong><br />George W. Bush is <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/01/20050120-1.html" target="_self">sworn-in</a> for second term as president of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>January 24, 2005 </strong><br />A U.S. District Court judge in Washington State rules that the Department cannot ship mixed transuranic (TRU) waste to the Hanford Site unless it deals with the waste that is already on the site. The state had filed suit in March 2003 to stop the shipment of waste to the site from other DOE sites that are being cleaned up. The Department plans to eventually ship all of the waste to the underground repository at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>January 26, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom's Trade and Industry Ministry <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/united-states-and-united-kingdom-cooperate-ridding-russia-weapons-grade-plut" target="_self">sign</a> a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to assist the permanent shutdown of the final operating weapons grade plutonium production reactor in the closed nuclear city of Zheleznogorsk, Russia. Under this MOU the United Kingdom will contribute $20M to NNSA's Elimination of Weapons Grade Plutonium Production Program (EWGPP). "The signing of this MOU is a major step in our collaborative efforts to address our mutual nonproliferation objectives," says NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks. "When the Zheleznogorsk reactor is finally shut down, there will be one less source of nuclear weapons grade plutonium in the world."</p>
<p><strong>January 28, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/nnsa-imposes-major-fee-penalty-response-los-alamos-safety-and-security-probl" target="_self">announces</a> it has imposed a major fee reduction of over $3 million on the University of California for management failures at the Los Alamos National Laboratory during Fiscal Year 2004. NNSA's action represents the largest fee reduction imposed on a national laboratory in DOE's history. The decision follows a year in which laboratory operations were suspended to address serious safety and security problems, including a report that two classified computer disks could not be located at the New Mexico laboratory. "Although multiple investigations have confirmed that the 'missing' disks never existed, the major weaknesses in controlling classified material revealed by this incident are absolutely unacceptable, and the University of California must be held accountable for them," says NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks in announcing the penalty.</p>
<p><strong>January 31, 2005 </strong><br />Samuel W. Bodman is unanimously confirmed by the Senate to serve as the next Secretary of Energy.</p>
<p><a name="feb" id="feb"><strong>January 31, 2005 </strong></a><br />The Department <a href="http://www.fossil.energy.gov/news/techlines/2005/tl_microhole_selections.html" target="_self">announces</a> the award of funding for 10 projects developing "microhole" technologies aimed at slashing the costs and reducing the environmental impacts of drilling America's oil and gas wells. The initiative involves developing technologies associated with drilling wells smaller than 4¾ inches in diameter and related downhole micro-instrumentation. The ultimate result of industry broadly embracing this technology could be a sea change in the way that the nation's oil and gas producers explore for, drill, and monitor wells. The total value of the projects is nearly $14.5 million, with DOE providing $7.7 million and industry partners contributing $6.8 million.</p>

<p><strong>February 1, 2005 </strong><br />Sam Bodman is <a href="../articles/bodman-sworn-11th-secretary-energy.html">sworn in</a> as the 11th Secretary of Energy. "It is a great honor and personal privilege to serve President Bush and the American people as Secretary of Energy," says Secretary Bodman. "I look forward to working with the fine men and women of the Energy Department to advance this department's critically important missions, including preserving America's pre-eminence in the physical sciences, ensuring the responsible stewardship of our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, advancing our international nuclear nonproliferation efforts, and ensuring reliable, secure, affordable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy for our growing economy."</p>
<p><strong>February 1, 2005 </strong><br />The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is established, combining the research and development components of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory West. Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC, <a href="https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1555&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_86074" target="_self">assumes</a> management and operational responsibility for the new laboratory, with the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology taking over programmatic responsibility within DOE. The Department intends INL to become the nation's premier laboratory for nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and education.</p>
<p><strong>February 1, 2005 </strong><br />Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen's <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr20050201-00" target="_self">proposed state budget</a> contains $8 million for funding the Joint Institute for Neutron Sciences research facility at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Located adjacent to ORNL's Spallation Neutron Source, the state facility will house researchers from both ORNL and the University of Tennessee who will study ways to improve the structure of materials. This is the third joint institute funded by the state and shared by ORNL and the University of Tennessee. The Joint Institute for Computational Sciences is open. Construction on the Joint Institute for Biological Sciences is scheduled to begin in late spring. All are located at ORNL.</p>
<p><strong>February 2, 2005 </strong><br />President Bush <a href="../articles/president-bush-highlights-energy-state-union-address.html">highlights energy </a>in the <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050202-11.html" target="_self">State of the Union address</a>. "We need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy," the President notes. "Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home -- including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology-from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough: I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy."</p>
<p><strong>February 3, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/department-energy-all-hands-meeting.html">speaks</a> to headquarters DOE employees in the auditorium of the Forrestal building in Washington, D.C. "My engineering background might give you some insight into my management style," he tells them. "The way I see it, my job is to identify opportunities and challenges and to empower results. In other words, I want to help you get things done right, and help you get the credit you deserve." Noting that at the age of 66 his appointment as energy secretary is not a career move, the Secretary says "I don't need credit for this. I came to serve this country, this president and this administration. To the extent that I have a reputation, it's already behind me." The Secretary speaks briefly on each of DOE's four major mission areas but spends more time on safety than on any other topic, noting that safety "is particularly important for agencies such as the DOE, with our high-tech science facilities, our large environmental cleanup operations, our work with nuclear materials, and our major construction projects. I want each and every employee of this department, whatever your job, to know that your personal safety and security is extremely important to me. As the leader of this department, I believe it is my moral and ethical responsibility to take this seriously, and I do. I also take it personally."</p>
<p><strong>February 7, 2005 </strong><br />The White House <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050207-11.html" target="_self">unveils</a> the Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal. At $23.4 billion, the Department's FY 2006 budget is $475 million below the FY 2005 appropriation. Of DOE's four "business lines," the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is $9.397 billion, a $233 million or 2.5 percent increase above the FY 2005 appropriation; for energy activities, the FY 2006 budget request at $2.567 billion is up $73 million or 3.0 percent compared to the FY 2005 appropriation; funding for the Office of Science is $3.463 billion, down $137 million or 3.8 percent; environment programs are $7.343 billion, down $502 million or 6.4 percent. The FY 2006 NNSA budget reflects the transfer from the Office of Environmental Management (EM) of funding for legacy cleanup and waste management activities at seven NNSA sites. The amount transferred to NNSA in FY 2006 for these activities is $222.3 million. Secretary Bodman notes that the budget cuts reflect tough choices made in a fiscally constrained time.</p>

Low precipitation is reducing hydro system performance for utilities and suppliers in the region, which increases power purchases from other, more costly sources. Low water in rivers is also shrinking expected surplus sales revenues. This puts upward pressure on rates.</p>
<p><strong>March 30, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew <a href="../articles/canada-and-united-states-cooperate-shut-down-one-last-weapons-grade-plutonium-production.html">announce</a> the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to assist with the permanent closure of one of the final operating weapons-grade plutonium production reactors in Russia. Under the MOU, Canada will contribute $9 million Canadian (U.S. $7 million) to DOE's Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production (EWGPP) program. The goal of the EWGPP program is to permanently shut down three Russian nuclear reactors and replace them with fossil energy plants. The Russian government has agreed to permanently shut down the reactors once replacement energy is provided. "Ending the production of weapons-grade plutonium is a non-proliferation priority for the United States and the international community," says Secretary Bodman.</p>

The facility will fabricate nuclear reactor fuel using surplus U.S. weapon-grade plutonium. Once the fuel is irradiated in existing commercial power reactors, the plutonium can no longer be readily used for nuclear weapons. A similar facility is being built in Russia to implement the U.S.-Russian Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, which commits both countries to dispose of 34 metric tons each of surplus weapon-grade plutonium. "Issuing the permit for construction of a MOX facility in South Carolina is the crucial next step in the MOX program," says Secretary Bodman in a <a href="../articles/energy-secretary-bodman-commends-key-milestone-mox-program.html">statement</a>.

Regular gasoline prices are projected to average $2.28 per gallon during this April through September summer season, 38 cents above the level the previous summer. Monthly average prices are projected to peak at about $2.35 per gallon in May. Summer motor gasoline demand is projected to average 9.3 million barrels per day, up 1.8 percent over the previous summer despite higher prices. The higher demand is caused by the increasing number of drivers and vehicles, and increasing miles traveled per vehicle. Crude oil prices are projected to remain above $50 per barrel for the rest of 2005 and 2006. High world oil demand, sparked by robust economic growth, continues to keep crude oil prices high and to increase competition for gasoline imports.</p>

This effort, by DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration and Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology, are the latest steps under the Global Threat Reduction Initiative's Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors program. As part of this program, NNSA is minimizing the use of HEU in civilian nuclear programs by converting research reactors and radioisotope production processes to the use of LEU fuel and targets. HEU is weapons-grade nuclear material that can be used to make a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb. "These research reactors are secure and used for peaceful purposes," Secretary Bodman says, "but by converting them to use low-enriched uranium, we are taking a significant step forward to ensure that weapons-usable nuclear material does not fall into the wrong hands."</p>

Using extraordinary precision, E158 determined that the strength of the weak force acting on two electrons lessens when the electrons are far apart. The precision measurements required enormous numbers of electrons. The SLAC linear accelerator sent 500 billion electrons in a single bunch to a target, and repeated this 700 million times. In half of these electron bunches, the electrons were polarized to spin right-handed. The electrons in the remaining bunches were polarized to spin left-handed. Some electrons entering the target scattered off target electrons by exchanging a mediator particle. The mediator is almost always a photon, which transmits the electromagnetic force (visible light, radio waves, x-rays). The collaboration's challenge was to find the rate of rare events; those one in a million electron-electron scatters that took place by exchanging a Z particle, which mediates the weak force.</p>

The EIA estimates that a return to normal operations, in terms of oil and natural gas production and distribution, will be achieved or nearly achieved by December. By the end of September all but about 0.9 million barrels per day of crude oil refining capacity likely will be back at full rates. Some "incremental crude oil price pressure," the EIA notes, may remain for up to 3 months. "Unfortunately, the hurricane season is not yet over," the EIA observes, "and the severity and location of hurricanes over the next few months could continue to influence U.S. and world oil markets. The EIA continues to emphasize that with limited spare global crude oil production capacity and the U.S. oil production and refining industries only beginning to recover from Katrina, oil prices are likely to react sharply to any additional disruption of or damage to petroleum infrastructure. How much higher prices may go and how long additional spikes would remain due to a particular storm would ultimately be determined by the severity of the incremental damage to petroleum facilities."</p>
<p><strong>September 8, 2005 </strong><br />In response to power outages brought about by Hurricane Katrina, the Bonneville Power Administration <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.piersystem.com%252Fgo%252Fdoc%252F1582%252F189907.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">delivers</a> six 30-kilowatt portable generators to the Portland Air Base for delivery by the Oregon Air National Guard to Louisiana. The generators will be used to power health facilities in areas where electrical infrastructure has been destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>September 8, 2005 </strong><br />In a front page article, the Wall Street Journal notes that in the immediate aftermath of Katrina the U.S. "slid perilously close to an energy crisis. The ability of one city-sized refinery in Baton Rouge to keep churning out gasoline amid the unfolding chaos stood in the way of that crisis. The Exxon complex, the second-largest in the U.S. after Exxon's refinery in Baytown, Texas, can handle 500,000 barrels of crude a day. It proved far enough away from the brunt of the storm to avoid direct damage. Even as it escaped, its ability to keep operating was imperiled by the severe crimp in the supply of crude oil. Some ingenious moves, including getting a legal waiver that permitted a foreign-owned tanker to ferry in crude, helped keep it going." Exxon "networked with government agencies-the Coast Guard, Homeland Security, the Department of Energy-to figure out what it would take to get the Gulf Coast infrastructure back in working order."</p>

The Secretary discusses the DOE's Katrina relief efforts, noting that as the severity of Katrina became apparent he "determined to commit the Department of Energy to doing everything in our power to meet the immediate needs of those affected by Hurricane Katrina, both on the Gulf Coast and throughout the rest of the country, and we have marshaled all of our resources to fulfill that commitment."</p>
<p><strong>September 9, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's Office of Science <a href="../articles/does-office-science-sets-program-aid-scientists-displaced-hurricane-katrina.html">announces</a> an initiative to institutions serving researchers and grantees displaced by Katrina. DOE's Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) launches an internet clearinghouse to facilitate matching displaced researchers to grant recipients. Office of Science Director Raymond Orbach notifies leaders of over 180 higher education institutions in the affected region; AAU and NASULGC, two large associations of colleges and universities; leaders of major professional science organizations and coalitions; Directors and Communication Directors of all 17 National Laboratories; Heads of Federal science agencies; and DOE and SC leadership teams.</p>
<p><strong>September 9, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's Savannah River Site <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/first-irradiated-tritium-rods-arrive-srs" target="_self">receives</a> its first shipment of tritium, the first produced by the U.S. in over 15 years. The Tritium Producing Burnable Absorber Rods will be stored until testing is completed at the new Tritium Extraction Facility, which is expected to begin operations in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>September 9, 2005 </strong><br />The Department announces that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) needs volunteers to assist the Federal government in the continuing response to Katrina and "encourages Federal employees who are interested in volunteering to do so." Volunteers will be deployed for 30-day minimum field assignments, and employee volunteers will continue in regular duty and pay status as DOE employees. DOE and FEMA will pay travel costs for volunteers. Over 100 potential volunteers respond.</p>
<p><strong>September 9, 2005 </strong><br />The Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service reports that 52 energy-production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are missing and 58 suffered damaged by Katrina nearly double the number of missing or damaged platforms reported September 6. Workers have returned to many offshore platforms restoring about half of the daily output from the Gulf but recovery has slowed. The Wall Street Journal reports that the "bearish news on the pace of infrastructure repairs raised specific concerns about the supply of natural gas for the coming home-heating season." Companies continue to assess damage in the Gulf to determine which pipelines, hub facilities, and platforms will require repairs.</p>
<p><strong>September 9, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) says that U.S. gasoline prices have either peaked or are near peak levels following the impact from Katrina. With Gulf Coast refineries, pipelines and production facilities returning to service and gasoline imports picking up over the next couple of weeks, gasoline prices will likely drop. EIA indicates that it may be awhile, however, before retail prices return to pre-hurricane levels.</p>
<p><strong>September 12, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman, in a <a href="../articles/canadian-council-chief-executives.html">speech</a> at a Washington, D.C., meeting of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, notes that in the wake of the devastation wrought by Katrina "Canada was the first foreign nation to offer aid to those trapped or displaced by the hurricane. In fact, the forty-six member Vancouver-based Urban Search and Rescue Team was the first rescue operation on the scene in the St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans. Its volunteers worked 18-hour days and rescued 119 people. Additional teams from Canadian power companies are among those helping to restore electricity to the affected areas. And four Canadian ships carrying essential and much-needed supplies, arrived in the Gulf a few days ago." The Secretary, "on behalf of President Bush and the American people," thanks Canada for the "outpouring of support in ships, personnel, medical and other supplies, and money-including a pledge of $5 million for humanitarian aid from the Province of Alberta-to aid the victims of the hurricane."</p>
<p><strong>September 12, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration releases the weekly Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update. As of September 11, the average weekly retail gasoline price decreased to $2.95 (down 11.4 cents from the previous week). Diesel fuel prices decreased 5.1 cents to $2.84.</p>
<p><strong>September 12, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman and Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton meet in Houston, Texas, with senior executives from two dozen energy companies. The executives say they need government help in arranging for housing for thousands of employees as they struggle to return the Gulf's oil and gas system to full operation.</p>
<p><strong>September 13, 2005 </strong><br />Secretaries Bodman and Norton tour the Gulf Region surveying the damage wrought by Katrina. The Secretaries visit the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at Bayou Choctaw in Plaquemine, Louisiana, where Secretary Bodman awards SPR the Secretary's Gold Medal for outstanding performance. The Secretaries then join Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta in Collins, Mississippi, to tour the Colonial and Plantation pipelines and thank employees and electric line crews for quickly restoring operations in the wake of Katrina.</p>
<p><strong>September 13, 2005 </strong><br />In the Department's Office of Science Katrina Relief Program, a biologist from Xavier University in New Orleans is <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr20051004-00" target="_self">successfully matched</a> with DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. ORNL will host this professor for five months and is also able to assist her spouse in finding a job and help the family find a home. By September 23, 13 scientists have applied through the Katrina relief program for supplementary assistance.</p>
<p><strong>September 13, 2005 </strong><br />The manager of the 494,000 barrels per day ExxonMobil refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announces that the refinery has no need to borrow any additional crude oil from DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The company secured a loan of 6 million barrels to make up for the interruption of supplies because of Katrina.</p>
<p><strong>September 14, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-announces-sale-11-million-barrels-crude-oil-nations-strategic-petroleum.html">announces</a> that DOE has approved bids for the sale of 11 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Combined with the 12.6 million barrels of crude previously approved for loans these SPR releases, in response to the disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina, will provide 23.6 million barrels of crude for the U.S. market. "The United States is committed to using all of the tools at our disposal to help keep our oil and gasoline markets well supplied," Secretary Bodman says. "This sale ensures that refineries have the petroleum they need to keep gasoline and diesel fuel flowing to American consumers while production facilities in the gulf region regain their capacity. As we move forward, we will continue to monitor the overall supply of petroleum available and the needs of the nation as we determine next steps."</p>
<p><strong>September 14, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration reports that gasoline demand is estimated at 8.63 million barrels per day for the week ending September 9, down 4.3 percent from the week before and 6.5 percent less than the comparable week in 2004. Gasoline demand fell 4 percent for the week that ended Sept. 2. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) fell by 6.6 million barrels from the previous week. At 308.4 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories remain above the upper end of the average range for this time of year. Total motor gasoline inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels last week, putting them at the bottom end of the average range.</p>
<p><strong>September 14, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/doe-signs-decision-move-moab-tailings.html">announces</a> that a Record of Decision (ROD) clearing the way for the removal of 11.9 million tons of radioactive Uranium Mill Tailings from the banks the Colorado River in Utah has been signed. Under the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Site ROD, the tailings will be moved, predominately by rail, to the proposed Crescent Junction, Utah, site more than 30 miles from the Colorado River.</p>
<p><strong>September 15, 2005 </strong><br />President Bush <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/print/20050915-8.html" target="_self">addresses</a> the nation from New Orleans, Louisiana, pledging support and "to stay as long as it takes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives." He also addresses the federal government's response to the disaster. "Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th, Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency," the President notes. "When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I, as President, am responsible for the problem, and for the solution. So I've ordered every Cabinet Secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane. This government will learn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina. We're going to review every action and make necessary changes, so that we are better prepared for any challenge of nature, or act of evil men, that could threaten our people."</p>
<p><strong>September 16, 2005</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/energy-secretary-bodman-tours-alabama-red-cross-facility-and-attends-national-day-prayer.html">travels</a> to Montgomery, Alabama, to commemorate a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance in honor of victims of Katrina. "On this day of prayer and remembrance, our thoughts and prayers are with all of the families of victims of this terrible storm," Secretary Bodman says. "On behalf of the Department of Energy, we are committed to carrying our relief efforts through to completion with the confidence that America's Gulf Coast will overcome the devastation of this disaster." While in Montgomery, the Secretary tours an American Red Cross Relief Operations Center, housed in what was once a K-Mart building. At the operations center, the Secretary thanks volunteers for their service toward the Hurricane Katrina relief effort. The Secretary also joins Alabama Governor Bob Riley, religious leaders, and Alabamans at Frazer United Methodist Church for a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance service to pay tribute to hurricane victims.</p>
<p><strong>September 16, 2005 </strong><br />The Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Services (MMS) provides the following estimates of Katrina damage to Outer Continental Shelf Infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico: 46 producing structures destroyed; 20 producing structures extensively damaged; 4 drilling rigs destroyed; 9 drilling rigs extensively damaged; and 6 rigs adrift (all rigs have been located, remanned, and are having power brought up on them). Most of the destroyed platforms were 30- year-old shelf platforms with minimal production in the West Delta, Grand Isle, and South Pass areas. MMS announces that oil and gas production in the Gulf should be up to about 90 percent of the pre-storm level by the end of October. However, while most of the production capacity can be restored by that time, some of the production will not be able to reach the market for as long as three months until repairs to other infrastructure elements such as pipelines and refineries can be completed. MMS also announces that Katrina did no major damage to the underwater pipelines in the Gulf.</p>

<p><strong>December 13, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/220-radioactive-sources-removed-georgia-school" target="_self">announces</a> the removal of 68,000 curies of radioactive cobalt-60 from the Neely Nuclear Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The 220 sealed sources of cobalt-60 were recovered in three separate loads by the Los Alamos National Laboratory for NNSA's Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) program and sent to the Nevada Test Site for permanent disposal. NNSA Administrator Linton F. Brooks commends the operation, saying it was important to keep dirty bomb material safe and secure from terrorists. To date, NNSA has recovered almost 12,000 radiation sources and placed them in safe and secure storage.</p>
<p><strong>December 15, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/department-energy-announces-24-nuclear-energy-research-awards-us-universities.html">announces</a> 24 research awards totaling $12 million over three years to U.S. universities to engage students and professors in DOE's advanced nuclear energy research and development programs, including the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative and Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>December 16, 2005 </strong><br />The Department notifies UT-Battelle, LLC and Fluor Hanford Inc. that it will fine the companies $110,000 and $206,250, respectively, for violations of DOE's nuclear safety requirements. UT-Battelle, LLC, is DOE's management and operating contractor for Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Fluor Hanford Inc. is a prime contractor at DOE's Hanford site near Richland, Washington.</p>
<p><strong>December 19, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/energy-department-sets-tougher-standards-clothes-washers-qualify-energy-star-label.html">announces</a> tougher standards for clothes washers to qualify for the ENERGY STAR® label, which lets American families identify which clothes washers save the most energy and use the least water. The new standards take effect January 1, 2007, and will increase the efficiency of new clothes washers up to 37 percent. The more energy-efficient clothes washers will have the potential to save up to $70 million in energy bills and 8.9 billion gallons of water each year.</p>
<p><strong>December 20, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../downloads/finaldoeorderdcpsc202-05-3pdf.html" target="_self">issues an order</a> (pdf) requiring Mirant Corporation's Potomac River Generating Station in Alexandria, Virginia (Mirant) to immediately resume limited operation. The order will help provide electric reliability for Washington, D.C., and will do so at the lowest reasonable impact to the environment. "This order will provide the level of electricity reliability necessary to keep Washingtonians safe and our national government running, while minimizing any environmental impact from the power station," Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/doe-orders-mirant-power-plant-operate-under-limited-circumstances.html" target="_self">says</a>. The Mirant plant is one of only three sources of electricity that serves the central business district of Washington, D.C., as well as many federal institutions and other nearby areas. If the Mirant plant is not operational, an outage of the high voltage transmission lines could cause a blackout lasting hours or even days. Secretary Bodman's order is in response to a request for an emergency order to restart the Mirant plant that was filed by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC). That request from the DCPSC came after a series of events that led to Mirant closing its plant.</p>
<p><strong>December 20, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/department-energy-awards-22-million-save-energy-pulp-and-paper-industry.html">awards</a> $2.2 million in research and development grants for projects to save energy in the pulp and paper industry. The research will focus on removing water from pulp in the paper making process and determining the technical and commercial feasibility of next generation manufacturing concepts.</p>
<p><strong>December 21, 2005 </strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/los-alamos-national-security-llc-selected-manage-los-alamos-national-laboratory.html">announces</a> in prepared <a href="../articles/los-alamos-national-laboratory-contract-announcement.html">remarks</a> that Los Alamos National Security LLC has been selected to be the management and operations contractor for DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Los Alamos National Security LLC is a limited liability corporation made up of Bechtel National, Inc., the University of California, BWX Technologies, Inc., and the Washington Group International, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>December 21, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/u.s.-works-georgia-and-azerbaijan-stop-nuclear-and-radioactive-material-smug" target="_self">announces</a> that agreements have been signed with the governments of Georgia and Azerbaijan to install radiation detection and integrated communications equipment at multiple border crossings, airports and seaports throughout the two nations. The work will be carried out by NNSA's Second Line of Defense program.</p>
<p><strong>December 22, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-cites-washington-tru-solutions-nuclear-safety-violations.html">notifies</a> Washington TRU Solutions (WTS) that it will fine the company $192,500 for violations of DOE's nuclear safety requirements</p>
<p><strong>December 27, 2005 </strong><br />The Department's Office of Science and National Nuclear Security Administration <a href="../articles/energy-department-requests-proposals-advanced-scientific-computing-research.html">issue a joint Request for Proposals</a> for advanced scientific computing research. DOE expects to fund $67 million annually for three years to five years under its Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) research program. Research proposals funded under the SciDAC program will help create a comprehensive, scientific computing software infrastructure that integrates applied mathematics, computer science, and computational science in the physical, biological, and environmental sciences for scientific discovery on petascale computers. Petascale computers will be capable of doing thousands of trillions of calculations per second. A simulation that would take 19 years to run on today's teraflop (1 trillion calculations/second) computers will only require a single week on a petascale computer.</p>
<p><strong>December 27, 2005 </strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/us-department-energy-awards-paducah-remediation-contract.html">announces</a> that Paducah Remediation Services, LLC, has been awarded a $191.6 million small business contract to perform environmental remediation and waste management activities at the DOE's Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. The contract, awarded as a result of a competition, will run through September 30, 2009, and provides incentives to the contractor for managing costs effectively while completing the cleanup work on schedule.</p>
