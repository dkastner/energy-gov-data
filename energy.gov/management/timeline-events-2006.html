<p><strong>January 1, 2006</strong><br />The energy efficiency tax credits signed into law by President Bush <a href="../articles/new-energy-efficiency-tax-credits-take-effect.html" target="_self">go into effect</a>, making it easier for American families and businesses to reduce energy costs at home, work, and on the road. Various tax credits are available for the purchase and installation of energy efficient appliances and products, as well as the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles such as hybrids. "While there are easy, immediate steps that families can take to reduce their energy bills-like turning down the thermostat or weather stripping doors and windows-these tax credits will help with the purchase of bigger ticket items," says Secretary Bodman. The energy efficiency tax credits will allow consumers to reduce their 2006 tax bills on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to the amount allowed under the law.</p>
<p><strong>January 3, 2006</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/department-energy-issues-draft-request-proposals-argonne-national-laboratory-contractor.html">announces</a> that it is seeking comments on a draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for the competitive selection of a management and operating (M&amp;O) contractor for Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2006</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/energy-departments-texas-pantex-plant-save-over-2-million-year-through-energy-efficiency.html">announces</a> that it has signed a contract to significantly improve energy efficiency at its Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, that will result in an estimated savings of over $2 million per year. Under the contract, NORESCO, an energy services company will oversee the improvements through an energy savings performance contract (ESPC).</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2006</strong><br />The Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory announces that lab scientists have discovered that a phenomenon called carrier multiplication, in which semiconductor nanocrystals respond to photons by producing multiple electrons, is applicable to a broader array of materials that previously thought. The discovery increases the potential for the use of nanoscrystals as solar cell materials to produce higher electrical outputs than current solar cells.</p>
<p><strong>January 6, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman attends the Pittsburgh Energy Summit 2006 to discuss how communities and companies fuel Pittsburgh's economy and how the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will impact jobs and the economy of Pennsylvania. In a panel <a href="../articles/us-energy-secretary-bodman-highlights-economic-incentives-energy-efficiency-pittsburgh.html">discussion</a>, the Secretary highlights the energy efficiency tax credits made available January 1, 2006. "Over the past year, America's economy has seen steady growth, even in the wake of hurricanes and higher gas prices." says Secretary Bodman. "One of the best ways to maintain this prosperity is by using our resources more efficiently and limiting America's energy demand." Following the summit, Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-visits-national-energy-technology-lab.html">tours</a> DOE's National Energy Technology Lab (NETL) in Pittsburgh and holds an all-hands meeting with NETL employees.</p>
<p><strong>January 9, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/energy-secretary-bodman-statement-hanford-solid-waste-settlement-agreement.html">announces</a> that DOE and the State of Washington have entered into a <a href="../downloads/microsoft-word-settlement-agreement-final-01-06-061doc.html" target="_self">settlement agreement</a> that will lead to a final order and the dismissal of the challenge to Hanford's Solid Waste Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in the lawsuit Washington v. Bodman. DOE, with Washington State as a cooperating agency, will prepare a new EIS that will include updated, site-wide groundwater analysis. In 2003, the state initiated litigation on issues related to the importation, treatment, and disposal of radioactive and hazardous waste generated off-site as a result of nuclear defense and research activities. In 2004, DOE issued the Hanford Solid Waste EIS, which evaluated potential environmental impacts of the storage, treatment and disposal of low-level, mixed-low level and transuranic waste at the Hanford Site. Washington amended its lawsuit to challenge the adequacy of this EIS. In July 2005, as part of the discovery process related to the 2003 lawsuit, DOE was informed by its support contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute, of discrepancies in the EIS data related to the impacts of waste disposal on Hanford's groundwater. The settlement agreement outlines DOE's plans for resolving the data quality issues identified.</p>
<p><strong>January 9, 2006</strong><br />The Department's Oak Ridge National Laboratory <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr20060109-00" target="_self">announces</a> the new Center for Radiation Detection Materials and Systems to consolidate and expand the lab's research and development efforts in radiation detection technologies.</p>
<p><strong>January 9, 2006</strong><br />A delegation of ten high-level Chinese officials attends a civilian nuclear power <a href="https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1555&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_85926" target="_self">workshop</a> at DOE's Idaho National Laboratory. The workshop is designed to explore technical areas of mutual interest and to set the framework for a cooperative program addressing identified technical issues.</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2006</strong><br />The Department's Joint Genome Institute (JGI) <a href="http://www.jgi.doe.govhttp://o.energy.gov/news/news_1_10_06.html" target="_self">releases</a> a <a href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/whoweare/JGI_Progress.pdf" target="_self">progress report</a> (pdf) for the years 2002 to 2005. The JGI, supported by DOE's Office of Science, unites the expertise of five national laboratories, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest, along with the Stanford Human Genome Center, to advance genomics in support of the DOE mission related to clean energy generation and environmental characterization and clean-up.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-begins-australia-visit.html">begins</a> a two day visit to Australia where he leads the U.S. delegation to the inaugural meeting of the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate (APP). The APP brings together governments and private sector entities from Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. to encourage the deployment of clean energy technologies and international cooperation in eight areas: cleaner fossil energy; renewable and distributed generation; power generation and transmission; aluminum; steel; cement; buildings and appliances; and mining. "The governments and private sectors of the APP countries have the historic opportunity to leverage the ingenuity of the private sector, the power of markets and the strength of the public sector to achieve a more secure energy future, a cleaner environment and greater prosperity in our own countries and around the world," Secretary Bodman says.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2006</strong><br />The Department's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) announces the launch of the Pacific Northwest GridWise Demonstration projects, a regional initiative to test and speed adoption of new smart grid technologies that can make the power grid more resilient and efficient. Through the projects, PNNL researchers will gain insight into energy consumers' behavior while testing new technologies designed to bring the electric transmission system into the information age. About 300 volunteers on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, in Yakima, Washington, and in Gresham, Oregon, will test equipment that is expected to make the grid more reliable, while offsetting huge investments in new transmission and distribution equipment.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2006</strong><br />The U.S. and India conclude a four-day <a href="../articles/us-and-india-conclude-first-workshop-civil-nuclear-working-group.html">workshop</a> on civilian nuclear energy, building on the U.S.-India Energy Dialogue initiated by President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in September 2004 and launched by Secretary Bodman and India Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia in May 2005. India hosts the first workshop of the Civil Nuclear Working group, which takes place in Mumbai. The workshop affords the two countries the opportunity to convene experts to initiate discussions and share information on the global demand for nuclear energy today and in the future; on safety, emergency response, security, physical protection, and current practices for safeguarding nuclear facilities; on production and use of medical isotopes; and on research in such areas as fusion energy, high energy physics, and nuclear physics. R. Shane Johnson, acting director of DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology represents the U.S. at the workshop.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/energy-secretary-announces-52-million-request-asia-pacific-partnership-clean-development.html">announces</a> that President Bush will request $52 million in the upcoming Fiscal Year 2007 budget to support the efforts of the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. The Partnership will focus on developing and commercializing cutting-edge technologies capable of effecting substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. "The greatest progress in addressing climate change will come through a cooperative effort that combines the best strategies of our governments with the technical know-how of the private sector," the Secretary says.</p>
<p><strong>January 16, 2006</strong><br />The U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Energy <a href="../articles/usda-and-doe-coordinate-research-plant-and-microbial-genomics.html">announce</a> they will share resources and coordinate the study of plant and microbial genomics, and the DOE will tackle the sequencing of the soybean genome as the first project resulting from the agreement. USDA and DOE will establish a framework to cooperate and coordinate agency-relevant plant and microbial genome sequencing and bioinformatics that can serve the needs of the broader scientific community and solve problems that are important to each agency's mission. This agreement could help speed the deployment of emerging technologies, such as improved methods of gene identification and sequence assembly. The DOE Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI) will sequence the genome (decode the DNA) of the soybean, the world's most valuable legume crop. Soybean is of particular interest to DOE because it is the principal source of biodiesel, a renewable, alternative fuel.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2006</strong><br />The Department's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management <a href="../articles/ocrwm-selects-sandia-lead-laboratory.html">designates</a> Sandia National Laboratories as its lead laboratory to integrate repository science work for the Yucca Mountain Project.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2006</strong><br />The DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program <a href="../articles/mobile-climate-monitoring-facility-sample-skies-africa.html">places</a> a new, portable atmospheric laboratory with sophisticated instruments and data systems in Niger, Africa, to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts of Saharan dust on global climate.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2006</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-issues-salt-waste-determination-savannah-river-site.html">issues</a> the waste determination for the treatment and stabilization of low activity salt-waste at the Savannah River Site allowing for significant reductions in environmental and health risks posed by the material. Stored in forty-nine underground tanks, approximately 36 million gallons of radioactive waste is left over from plutonium production during the Cold War. In addition, DOE issues an amended Record of Decision and Implementation Plan to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2006</strong><br />The New Horizons spacecraft, powered by deep space battery technology <a href="../articles/doe-technology-helps-nasa-seek-new-horizons.html">developed</a> by DOE's national laboratories successfully launches from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on a 9-1/2 year journey to explore Pluto and its moons. The spacecraft will receive heat and electricity from a long-lasting plutonium-238 powered generator developed and assembled by scientists and engineers at the Idaho, Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Laboratories. "This technology is a tremendous example of how DOE's national laboratories are helping to significantly expand scientific research and discovery," says Secretary Bodman. Each laboratory played an integral role in the development, assembly and testing of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator or "RTG"-a power system or "space battery" that provides an uninterrupted and reliable source of heat and electricity in remote and harsh environments such as deep space.</p>
<p><strong>January 20, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/doe-announces-three-projects-help-gulf-coast-recover-and-rebuild.html">announces</a> three initiatives to help the people in the Gulf coast region recover from the hurricanes in 2005, as well as prevent loss of life and damage in the future. During his <a href="../articles/energy-leadership-forum.html">speech</a> to the Energy Leadership Forum, the Secretary says that DOE will donate 400,000 hours of supercomputing time at its National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This will allow the Corps to run hurricane simulations to help model hurricane-induced storm surge elevations so coastal levees can be strengthened and offer more protection to low-lying areas. DOE is also offering hurricane-affected residents free rebuilding workshops providing expert advice on the latest energy-efficient products and techniques. In addition, DOE will donate 200 pieces of furniture to Belle Chasse High School in Belle Chasse, Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>January 20, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/department-energy-announces-oil-loan-strategic-petroleum-reserve.html">approves</a> an emergency loan of 871,000 barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the Total Petrochemicals USA, Inc. refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. This loan comes in response to a barge accident in the Sabine Neches Ship Channel earlier in the week, during which 94 concrete pilings dropped from the barge into the channel. In order to ensure that this accident does not put a strain on U.S. supplies of refined products, the delivery of crude oil from the West Hackberry SPR site will begin tomorrow. "The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a national asset that can be used in times of supply disruption," the Secretary says. "In providing this loan, the SPR is doing exactly what it was intended to do-mitigate any supply disruption and minimize, to the extent possible, the effect any disruption would have on the American people."</p>
<p><strong>January 23, 2006</strong><br />New <a href="../articles/stronger-manufacturers-energy-efficiency-standards-residential-air-conditioners-go-effect.html">manufacturing standards</a> issued by DOE to increase the energy efficiency of residential air conditioners for products manufactured in, or imported into, the U.S. go into effect. Residential air conditioner systems (not window box air conditioners), manufactured after January 23, 2006, must achieve a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) of 13 or higher. A SEER rating of 13 is 30 percent more efficient than the current 10 SEER standard. The 13 SEER central air conditioner standard is predicted to save the nation 4.2 quads (quadrillion British Thermal Units) of energy over the next 25 years. This is equivalent to the energy consumed by nearly 26 million American households annually. The standard is expected to save consumers $1 billion over the same period.</p>
<p><strong>January 24, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman kicks off the Washington Auto Show with the <a href="../articles/energy-secretary-bodman-announces-119-million-funding-and-roadmap-advance-hydrogen-fuel.html">announcement</a> of $119 million in funding and a research "roadmap" aimed at identifying and overcoming the technical and manufacturing challenges associated with the further development of commercially available hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. "Investments in fuel cell and hydrogen research today will enable America to lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles that will reduce our dependence on imported oil," says the Secretary. DOE's <a href="http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/roadmap_manufacturing_hydrogen_economy.pdf" target="_self"><em>Roadmap on Manufacturing R&amp;D for the Hydrogen Economy</em></a> (pdf) addresses challenges to manufacturing, storage and production of fuel cell technologies and proposes R&amp;D solutions to overcome such challenges, focusing primarily on near commercial technologies.</p>

<p><strong>April 5, 2006</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/doe-send-proposed-yucca-mountain-legislation-congress.html">sends</a> to Congress a legislative proposal to enhance the nation's ability to manage and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at DOE's Yucca Mountain repository site in Nevada. The proposed legislation includes a comprehensive set of provisions that will facilitate licensing and construction of the geologic repository and will lead to the safe, permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste deep within the mountain. The legislation would withdraw permanently from public use the land at and surrounding the Yucca Mountain repository site, and would facilitate Congress' ability to provide adequate funding for the Yucca Mountain Project. Permanent withdrawal is needed to meet a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing requirement and will help assure protection of public health and the environment. Funding reform is necessary to correct a technical budgetary problem that has acted as a disincentive to adequate funding. The proposed bill would also eliminate the current statutory 70,000 metric ton cap on disposal capacity at Yucca Mountain, in order to allow maximum use of the mountain's true technical capacity. This provision would help provide the safe isolation of the nation's entire commercial spent nuclear fuel inventory from existing reactors, including life extensions.</p>

The strongest growth is expected in developing countries in Asia, including China and India, where robust economic growth drives the increase in energy use. Projected world oil prices are 35% higher in 2025 than in last year's IEO, reflecting a more pessimistic view of the willingness of oil-rich countries to expand production capacity as aggressively as previously envisioned. Petroleum consumption is still expected to grow strongly, however, reaching 118 million barrels per day in 2030. The U.S., China, and India together account for 51% of the projected growth in world oil use. Higher fossil fuel prices and concerns about security of energy supplies are expected to improve prospects for nuclear power capacity over the projection period, and many countries are expected to build new nuclear power plants. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are projected to rise from 25.0 billion metric tons in 2003 to 33.7 billion metric tons in 2015 and 43.7 billion metric tons in 2030. Much of the projected increase in emissions is expected to occur in developing regions of the world, accompanying large increases in fossil fuel use.</p>

<p><strong>August 7, 2006</strong><br />The Department <a href="http://www.fossil.energy.govhttp://o.energy.gov/news/techlines/2006/06047-Methane_Hydrate_Project_Awards.html" target="_self">announces</a> the selection of six cost-shared methane hydrate research and development projects seeking to unlock this huge potential source of hydrocarbon energy. Methane hydrate is an ice-like solid that results from the trapping of methane molecules-the main constituent of natural gas-within a lattice-like cage of water molecules. In the U.S., where methane hydrate occurs beneath the permafrost of Alaska's arctic north and below the seabed offshore, methane hydrate deposits could hold as much as 200,000 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas. This compares with a non-hydrate U.S. natural gas resource of 25,000 Tcf-of which only 1,400 Tcf is deemed recoverable with current technology. Apart from the vast energy potential of methane hydrate, there are some serious safety and environmental concerns. These concerns as well as DOE's goal of developing methane production from hydrate will be addressed by the six projects. DOE will provide about $4.6 million of the six projects' total combined costs of roughly $5.8 million.</p>

<p><strong>December 4, 2006</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/nnsa-marks-major-milestone-tritium-production" target="_self">announces</a> that the Tritium Extraction Facility (TEF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS) has begun operations and tritium can now be extracted from target rods, ensuring a sustainable supply of tritium for the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen gas that is an integral component in the nuclear weapons stockpile. It must be replenished in weapons periodically because it has a half-life of only 12.3 years. The $506 million TEF follows a $142 million upgrade of an existing SRS facility, called the Tritium Modernization and Consolidation Project. The upgrade allowed for the shut down and deactivation of SRS' original tritium facilities, which operated for almost a half century.</p>
<p><strong>December 4, 2006</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/us-department-energy-awards-contract-management-and-operation-ames-laboratory-iowa-state.html">awards</a> a new $150 million, five-year contract for management and operation of Ames Laboratory to Iowa State University.</p>
<p><strong>December 5, 2006</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/new-world-record-achieved-solar-cell-technology.html">announces</a> that a concentrator solar cell produced by Boeing-Spectrolab with DOE funding has recently achieved a world-record conversion efficiency of 40.7 percent, establishing a new milestone in sunlight-to-electricity performance. The breakthrough may lead to systems with an installation cost of only $3 per watt, producing electricity at a cost of 8-10 cents per kilowatt/hour, making solar electricity a more cost-competitive and integral part of the nation's energy mix. Researchers for the past two decades have sought to break the "40 percent efficient" barrier on solar cell devices.</p>
<p><strong>December 5, 2006</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press277.html" target="_self">releases</a> its <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo07/index.html" target="_self">Annual Energy Outlook 2007</a>. The EIA projects that world crude oil prices will decline gradually from their 2006 average level through 2015 as new supplies come to market in response to the higher prices and expanded exploration and development investments. After 2015, real prices begin to rise as demand continues to grow and higher cost supplies are brought to market. In 2030, real world crude oil prices are projected to reach over $59 per barrel in 2005 dollars, or about $95 per barrel in nominal dollars. Average real natural gas wellhead prices also are projected to fall as increased drilling brings on new supplies and new import sources become available. After 2013, natural gas wellhead prices are projected to increase gradually. Coal will remain the primary fuel for electricity generation, with coal's share of generation increasing from 50 percent in 2005 to 57 percent in 2030. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent per year, from 5,945 million metric tons in 2005 to 7,950 million metric tons in 2030, reflecting growth in fossil fuel demand. Total nuclear generation is projected to, but the nuclear share of generation falls from 20 percent in 2005 to 15 percent in 2030.</p>
