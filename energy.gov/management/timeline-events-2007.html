<p><strong>January 4, 2007</strong><br />Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman <a href="../articles/nnsa-administrator-depart.html">announces</a> the resignation of Linton Brooks, Administrator of DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). "During my tenure," the Secretary says, "there have been a number of management issues involving the National Nuclear Security Administration, the most recent of which was a serious security breach several months ago at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These management and security issues can have serious implications for the security of the United States." The Secretary notes that while "the current NNSA management has done its best to address these concerns, I do not believe that progress in correcting these issues has been adequate." The Secretary states that "I have decided that it is time for new leadership at the NNSA, and I have asked for the resignation of NNSA Administrator, Linton Brooks."</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2007</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/department-energy-releases-notice-intent-gnep-environmental-impact-statement.html">announces</a> that a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for President Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) Initiative is posted in the Federal Register. The NOI outlines the programmatic and project-specific proposals of GNEP. GNEP will recycle spent nuclear fuel and destroy its long-lived radioactive components. To accomplish this, DOE proposes to design, build, and operate three facilities: 1) a nuclear fuel recycling center, which would separate spent nuclear fuel into reusable and waste components and then manufacture new nuclear fast reactor fuel using the reusable components; 2) an advanced recycling reactor, which would destroy long-lived radioactive elements in the new fuel while generating electricity; 3) an advanced fuel cycle research facility, which would perform research and development into spent nuclear fuel recycling processes and other advanced nuclear fuel cycles. DOE will consider 13 sites as possible locations for one or more of the proposed GNEP facilities.</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2007</strong><br />The Democrat-controlled 110th Congress opens with lawmakers introducing a number of energy-related bills.</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Ames Laboratory announces that researchers have developed a material with a negative refractive index for visible light. The silver-based, mesh-like material marks the latest advance in the rapidly evolving field of metamaterials that could lead to a wide range of new applications as varied as ultrahigh-resolution imaging systems and cloaking devices. Metamaterials, also known as left-handed materials, are exotic, artificially created materials that provide optical properties not found in natural materials. They have been heralded as the first step in creating an invisibility cloak.</p>
<p><strong>January 5, 2007</strong><br />President Bush <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070105-1.html" target="_self">designates</a> Thomas D'Agostino to be Acting Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). D'Agostino currently serves as Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs at NNSA.</p>
<p><strong>January 8, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Office of Science <a href="../articles/does-office-science-awards-95-million-hours-supercomputing-time-advance-research-science.html">announces</a> that 45 projects were awarded a total of 95 million hours of computing time on some of the world's most powerful supercomputers located at DOE facilities as part of its 2007 Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program. The supercomputers will allow cutting-edge research and design of virtual prototypes to be carried out in weeks or months, rather than the years or decades that would be needed using conventional computing systems. Launched in 2003, the INCITE mission is to advance American science and industrial competitiveness. The projects, with applications from aeronautics to astrophysics, consumer products to combustion research, were competitively chosen based on the potential impact of the science and engineering research and the suitability of the project for use of supercomputers. Practical applications of the research include designing quieter cars, improving commercial aircraft design, advancing fusion energy, studying supernovas, understanding nanomaterials, and studying global climate change and the causes of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p><strong>January 8, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/LighterHiggs.html" target="_self">announces</a> that scientists of the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) collaboration have made the world's most precise measurement by a single experiment of the mass of the W boson, the carrier of the weak nuclear force and a key parameter of the Standard Model of particles and forces. The new W-mass value leads to an estimate for the mass of the yet-undiscovered Higgs boson that is lighter than previously predict.</p>
<p><strong>January 9, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman and Akira Amari, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan, <a href="../articles/united-states-japan-cooperation-energy-security.html">meet</a> in Washington to review current and prospective cooperative activities in the energy field. Topics of discussion include diversifying the energy mix, specifically focusing on nuclear power but also including clean coal efforts, information exchange on methane hydrates, and renewable energy as key alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Other topics of discussion include improving energy efficiency, improving investment climate in energy producing countries, and engaging emerging economies, particularly China and India, as crucial for ensuring global energy security.</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2007</strong><br />The European Union proposes a new <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Feuropa.eu%252Flegislation_summaries%252Fenergy%252Feuropean_energy_policy%252Fl27067_en.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_self">energy policy</a> that will reduce energy consumption by 20 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2007</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/department-energy-releases-global-nuclear-energy-partnership-strategic-plan.html">releases</a> the <a href="http://www.ne.doe.gov/peis/references/RM792_DOE_2007l.pdf" target="_self">Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) Strategic Plan</a> (pdf), which details the initiative's purpose, principles, and implementation strategy. The Plan outlines a path forward to enable worldwide increase in the use of safe, emissions-free nuclear energy without contributing to the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities in a manner that responsibly addresses the waste produced. The Strategic Plan provides a framework to expand nuclear power to meet growing energy demand; develop, demonstrate, and deploy advanced technologies for recycling spent nuclear fuel without separating plutonium; develop, demonstrate, and deploy advance reactors that consume transuranics; establish reliable fuel services worldwide; develop, demonstrate, and deploy proliferation resistant reactors appropriate to power grids and; and develop enhanced safeguards to ensure nuclear energy systems are used for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Office of Fossil Energy <a href="http://www.fossil.energy.gov/news/techlines/2007/07001-Oil_Shale_Technology_Project.html" target="_self">announces</a> that a DOE-funded project has successfully demonstrated the viability of a new low-cost, low-impact technology to develop the nation's oil shale resources. The project, conducted by Composite Technology Development Inc. and managed by DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory, involves the heating of oil shale in situ, several thousand feet below the surface, separating the kerogen without mining the oil shale rock. The petroleum-like liquid is rendered mobile enough to be pumped to the surface. If ongoing research continues to confirm the technology's effectiveness, its application offers the potential to dramatically reduce costs and environmental impacts in the extraction of oil from oil shale. The U.S. holds more than three-fourths of the world's estimated 2.6 trillion barrels of oil-in-place of oil shale resources. As much as 1.1 trillion barrels of oil equivalent is believed to be recoverable in the richest single deposit-the Green River formation of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. That volume is almost 50 percent greater than the combined proved reserves of conventional oil in the entire Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2007/01/11/a-new-target-for-the-treatment-of-breast-cancer" target="_self">announces</a> that researchers have demonstrated that inhibiting the activity of the protease enzyme known as TACE can deprive tumor cells of a key factor needed for their proliferation. TACE is strongly present in one of the deadliest forms of breast cancer that responds poorly to current therapies. As a result, the active ingredient in a drug currently being tested to treat rheumatoid arthritis could serve as an effective means of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/doe-announces-us-russia-fourth-report-bratislava-agreement.html">announces</a> that he and Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency Director Sergey Kiriyenko have submitted to Presidents Bush and Putin the fourth report of the Senior Interagency Working Group on implementation of the February 2005 Bratislava Checklist. The report highlights progress over the past six months, including a U.S. and Russian collaborative radiological source search/consequence management exercise and the completion of cooperative material protection, control and accounting system upgrades at several Russian nuclear sites, as well as the return of more than 590 pounds of highly enriched uranium from a former East German civilian nuclear facility to Russia (see December 18, 2006, entry).</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2007</strong><br />Crude oil prices drop to $50.48 a barrel, the lowest price since May 2005. Oil is down over a third from its high of $77.03 on July 14, 2006.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/statement-energy-secretary-samuel-w-bodman-house-passage-hr-6-creating-long-term-energy.html">issues</a> a statement commending the House for passage of H.R.6: Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for The Nation Act. The bill seeks to reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, promoting new emerging energy technologies, developing greater efficiency, and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in alternative energy, and for other purposes. Noting the Department's "areas of agreement" with the proposed legislation, the Secretary also cites "areas of disagreement" and suggests changes to improve the bill.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-celebrates-clean-completion-three-former-weapons-research-and-production.html">certifies</a> that environmental cleanup is complete at three former weapons research and production facilities in Ohio: the Fernald Closure site in Crosby Township, the Columbus Closure site at the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Ashtabula Closure Project at the Reactive Metal Inc. As part of the cleanup and restoration effort, workers safely demolished hundreds of contaminated buildings, treated and disposed of millions of tons of waste, and performed extensive soil and groundwater remediation. "Today we honor the rich past of these sites that played a critical role in the Cold War and celebrate the efforts to restore their environmental health," the Secretary declares at the <a href="../articles/ohio-closure-projects-ceremony.html">closure ceremony</a>. "The Department of Energy has cleaned up over 1,100 acres in Ohio and, due to the many lessons learned at these sites, we are on track to safely clean up five additional sites across the nation in the next two years." DOE will return 31 acres at the Columbus site to Battelle Memorial Institute and 42 acres at the Ashtabula site to Reactive Metals Incorporated for unrestricted industrial reuse. At Fernald, DOE will manage the long term protection of the 1,050 acre site as an undeveloped nature and wildlife reserve through monitoring and sampling of the 180 wells and groundwater. In addition, DOE will operate a Groundwater Treatment Facility to safely pump and treat water to the Great Miami Aquifer. DOE will open an education center at Fernald that will offer members of the community and visitors a place to learn about the history of the site.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability <a href="../oe/downloads/plug-hybrid-electric-vehicles.html" target="_self">releases</a> a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles that finds there is enough electric capacity to power plug-in vehicles across much of the nation. "Off-peak" electricity production and transmission capacity could fuel 84 percent of the 198 million cars, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles in the nation if they were plug-in hybrid electrics.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2007</strong><br />The General Accountability Office (GAO) releases a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07106.pdf" target="_self">report</a> (pdf) on DOE's energy research and development efforts. The GAO finds that "DOE's total budget authority for energy R&amp;D dropped by over 85 percent (in real terms) from 1978 to 2005, peaking in the late 1970s but falling sharply when oil prices returned to lower levels in the mid-1980s." This has resulted in a more narrowed R&amp;D focus, and "the government has relied on the market to determine whether to deploy advanced energy technologies." The market, however, "has been slow to embrace advanced energy technologies because they typically are not economically competitive with conventional energy sources such as oil, natural gas, and coal. In part this is because the prices U.S. consumers pay for conventional energy do not reflect their true costs, including the costs of certain adverse environmental impacts." The GAO concludes that it is "unlikely that DOE's current level of R&amp;D funding or the nation's current energy policies will be sufficient to deploy alternative energy sources in the next 25 years that will reverse our growing dependence on imported oil or the adverse environmental effects of using conventional fossil energy."</p>
<p><strong>January 21, 2007</strong><br />Raymond L. Orbach, DOE's Under Secretary for Science, <a href="../articles/global-science-gateway-agreement-signed-london.html">signs</a> an agreement with Lynne Brindley, Chief Executive, the British Library, to partner on the development of a global science gateway. The gateway would eventually make science information resources of many nations accessible via a single Internet portal. Dubbed "Science.world," the planned resource would be available to scientists in all nations and to anyone interested in science. The approach will capitalize on existing technology to search vast collections of science information distributed around the globe, enabling much-needed access to smaller, less well-known sources of highly valuable science. Following the model of Science.gov, the U.S. interagency science portal that relies on content published by each participating agency, "Science.world" will rely on scientific resources published by each participating nation. Other countries have been invited to participate in this international effort.</p>
<p><strong>January 22, 2007</strong><br />An 18-member assessment panel commissioned by DOE releases its report on <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/future_geothermal.html" target="_self"><em>The Future of Geothermal Energy</em></a>. The panel concludes that "with a combined public/private investment of about $800 million to $1 billion over a 15 year period, EGS [Enhanced Geothermal Systems] technology could be deployed commercially on a timescale that would produce more than 100,000 MW or 100 GW of new capacity by 2050." With a "reasonable investment in R&amp;D and a proactive level of deployment in the next 10 years, the panels notes, geothermal could be "a major player in supplying 10% of U.S. base-load electricity by 2050."</p>

<p><strong>January 23, 2007</strong><br />President Bush, in his <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html" target="_self">State of the Union address</a>, asks Congress to join him in pursuing the "great goal" of reducing gasoline usage by 20 percent in the next 10 years. To reach the "20 in 10" goal, the President states, the supply of alternative fuels must be increased by setting a mandatory fuels standard requiring 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017, and fuel economy standards for cars must be reformed and modernized resulting in the conservation of up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. The President also notes that the way to move forward in diversifying America's energy supply is through technology, and he calls for changing the way America generates electric power by greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. "America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil," the President says. "And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change." He also asks Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<p><strong>January 23, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/statement-energy-secretary-samuel-w-bodman-expansion-strategic-petroleum-reserve-15-billion.html">declares</a> that expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a "wise and prudent policy decision." The SPR currently holds about 691 million barrels of crude oil, which is the approximate equivalent of 55 days of net imports. Expanding the SPR to 1.5 billion barrels would result in an approximately 97 day supply of net import protection. The Secretary tells reporters that he expects DOE to begin purchasing crude oil in the spring at a rate of about 100,000 barrels per day.</p>

Required by the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act and developed in consultation with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Nuclear Weapons Council, the report says that the complex's total square footage and the number of employees funded by NNSA's nuclear weapons accounts could each be reduced by as much as one-third in the future. The report also notes that it is NNSA's goal to carry out Complex 2030 within existing funding levels and program structures. According to the report, NNSA will analyze four different alternatives in its ongoing environmental assessment of Complex 2030, which are: a "No Action Alternative" to analyze the impact of no infrastructure changes; a "Distributed Centers of Excellence Transformation Alternative" to analyze the transformation of the complex to one that is smaller, more efficient, and more responsive; a "Consolidated Nuclear Production Center Transformation Alternative" to analyze a single facility for all nuclear weapon's research, development, and production activities; and a "Capability-Based Alternative" to analyze reducing the production facilities to nominal levels.</p>

At $24.3 billion, the Department's FY 2008 budget request is $706 million more than the FY 2007 request. Of DOE's four "business lines," the National Nuclear Security Administration is $9.387 billion, a $71 million or .8 percent increase above the FY 2007 request; for energy activities, the FY 2008 budget request at $3.089 billion is up $506 million or 19.6 percent compared to the FY 2007 request; funding for the Office of Science is $4.398 billion, up $296 million or 7.2 percent; environment programs are $6.344 billion, down $230 million or 3.5 percent. Fossil energy at $863 million is up 33.0 percent from the FY 2007 request while nuclear energy at $875 million is up 38.2 percent. "Under President Bush's leadership, this budget builds on our commitment to strengthen our nation's energy security by diversifying our energy resources and reducing our reliance on foreign sources of energy," the Secretary notes. "In addition, this budget will help us expand our nation's scientific know-how, protect generations from the dangers of our Cold War legacy, and safely and reliably maintain our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile."</p>

<p><strong>February 7, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Sandia National Laboratories <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/blade.html" target="_self">announces</a> the development of a new wind turbine blade design promising to be more efficient than current designs. Named "STAR" for Sweep Twist Adaptive Rotor, the blade is the first of its kind produced at a utility-grade size. Its most distinctive characteristic is a gently curved tip, termed "sweep," which unlike the vast majority of blades in current use, is specially designed for low-wind-speed regions like the Midwest. The sites targeted by this effort have annual average wind speeds of 5.8 meters per second, measured at 10-meter height. Such sites are abundant in the U.S. and would increase by 20-fold the available land area that can be economically developed for wind energy.</p>

<p><strong>February 14, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman, in a <a href="../articles/cera-conference.html">speech</a> before the CERA energy conference in Houston, discusses energy security as an economic and national security issue. He says that "initiatives, new or old which seek to control the flow of energy supplies to the market and circumvent the role of the market to set prices are contrary to the long term interests of both producers and consumers." The Secretary's remarks follow on Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to the Middle East where he discussed forming an international natural gas cartel. After his speech, the Secretary notes that "all countries can act as they see fit, but I think it's fair to say that efforts to manipulate markets, trying to organize the suppliers in such a fashion, over the long term is not going to accrue to the benefit of suppliers."</p>
<p><strong>February 14, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-signs-record-decision-new-spr-site.html">announces</a> that Richton, Mississippi, will be the site for the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). "The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a national asset intended to protect the U.S. against severe supply disruptions that could harm our economy and threaten our national security," says the Secretary. "Today's designation of Richton, MS, as the home of the fifth site of our nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve will make America stronger, and make her a more secure and prosperous nation." The other four SPR sites, two in Louisiana and two in Texas, are situated along the Gulf coast. As an inland site, Richton will have less vulnerability to hurricane impacts and will be connected by pipeline to the Capline pipeline system and to refiners and marine facilities in Pascagoula for oil distribution. Adding to the current Reserve will happen in stages over the next two decades to coincide with the construction and expansion of DOE's facilities.

The proposed legislation requests authority to use a more streamlined rulemaking process for certain products when a clear consensus for a standard exists. DOE would be able to prescribe energy efficiency standards by direct final rule when all relevant interests-manufacturers, stakeholders, and state governments-jointly negotiate and submit an agreed proposed standard. Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, DOE is required to set energy conservation standards for certain residential and commercial appliances and equipment. EPACT 2005 amended EPCA to add additional residential and commercial appliances and equipment to the existing program. The proposed legislation applies to all of the EPCA products, including those added by EPACT 2005.</p>

The University of California was the contractor responsible for managing and operating the laboratory when the violations occurred in 2005. The Preliminary Notice of Violation (PNOV) cites multiple violations of the Department's nuclear safety requirements associated with operational events and performance deficiencies at the laboratory. Due to the University's statutory exemption from such penalties at the time of the violations, no civil penalties were issued in this PNOV. However, had the exemption not been in place, DOE would have issued a fine of $1.1 million based on the number and severity of violations and this would have been the single largest civil penalty in the history of the enforcement program. The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 authorizes DOE to undertake regulatory actions against contractors for violations of its nuclear safety requirements.</p>
<p><a name="mar" id="mar"><strong>February 28, 2007</strong></a><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/biorefinery-grant-announcement.html">announces</a> that DOE will invest up to $385 million for six biorefinery projects over the next four years. When fully operational, the biorefineries are expected to produce more than 130 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year. Combined with the industry cost share, more than $1.2 billion will be invested in the six biorefineries. The goal is to make cellulosic ethanol cost-competitive with gasoline by 2012. "These biorefineries will play a critical role in helping to bring cellulosic ethanol to market, and teaching us how we can produce it in a more cost effective manner," the Secretary says. "Ultimately, success in producing inexpensive cellulosic ethanol could be a key to eliminating our nation's addiction to oil.

<p><strong>March 2, 2007</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) announces that the Nuclear Weapons Council approved a design for a joint NNSA and U.S. Navy program to provide a replacement warhead for a portion of the nation's sea-based nuclear weapons that will provide means to ensure long-term confidence in a more secure, smaller and safer nuclear weapons stockpile. The design team from NNSA's Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories was selected to develop the Reliable Replacement Warhead. NNSA and the national laboratories have determined that this design can be certified without requiring underground nuclear testing.

The report, Root Cause Analysis Report in Response to Condition Report 5223 Regarding Emails Suggesting Noncompliance with Quality Assurance Requirements, reflects the findings of a Root Cause Analysis Team. The Team found that the negative attitudes toward quality assurance requirements reflected in the USGS emails were not pervasive throughout the OCRWM program. While the Root Cause Analysis Team also found no evidence that information associated with the USGS work was falsified or modified as suggested in the emails, certain of the infiltration modeling products on which these employees worked did not meet OCRWM's traceability and transparency requirements. The Team further found that corrective actions to address issues associated with the infiltration products were not always effective. The report identified as the root cause of these conditions a failure by OCRWM senior management to establish and hold the OCRWM organization accountable for meeting quality expectations with regard to the USGS infiltration products.

<p><strong>March 29, 2007</strong><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07283.pdf" target="_self">reports</a> (pdf) that oil production likely will peak sometime between now and 2040. The GAO finds that if the peak occurs "soon, without warning," and with a sharp drop in oil production, "consequences would be most dire." Prices would rise, "possibly to unprecedented levels," resulting in "severe economic damage." The United States, "as the largest consumer of oil and one of the nations most heavily dependent on oil for transportation, may be especially vulnerable among the industrialized nations of the world." Noting that the federal government has "no coordinated or well-defined strategy either to reduce uncertainty about the timing of a peak or to mitigate its consequences," the GAO recommends that the "Secretary of Energy take the lead, in coordination with other relevant agencies, to prioritize federal agency efforts and establish a strategy for addressing peak oil issues."</p>

Gasoline prices have surged over the last 2 months, rising by more than 60 cents per gallon due to higher crude oil prices, unplanned refinery outages, increased demand for gasoline, and low levels of gasoline imports from Europe. Crude oil prices are expected to average over $65 per barrel over the summer (compared with $70 per barrel in summer 2006) and average close to $64 per barrel annually for both 2007 and 2008. Despite recent increases in world oil prices, global oil demand is projected to grow by 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2007 and 1.6 million bbl/d in 2008. About one-half of the projected growth in world oil consumption is in China and the U.S.</p>

In total, this phase is valued at $42.5 million, and DOE is responsible for providing funding of $31.5 million. The funding will provide for the project's conceptual and preliminary designs, final site selection, and the negotiation of a site agreement. Additionally, DOE is responsible for completion of the NEPA process (at an approximate cost of $25 million). The agreement also outlines updated overall cost estimates for the project. Under the terms of the 74% government, 26% industry cost share agreement, the initial total project cost estimate was $950 million, with a government share of $700 million. While the scope and size of the project have not changed, the price of construction materials and equipment, labor, and other heavy construction expenses have significantly increased, driving the total estimated cost of the FutureGen project to $1.7 billion through 2016, offset by about $300 million in anticipated power revenue. The DOE portion of the net total project cost is expected to be slightly over $1 billion and the FutureGen Alliance share is expected to be just under $400 million.</p>

<p><strong>May 7, 2007</strong><br />The Department receives payment of $39.2 million from Dakota Gasification Company, a subsidiary of Basin Electric Power Cooperative, under a revenue sharing agreement signed in 1988 concerning the sale of synthetic natural gas from the Great Plains Synfuels Plant near Beulah, North Dakota. The Great Plains plant is the only U.S. commercial-scale gasification plant that produces synthetic natural gas from coal. In the early 1980s, DOE guaranteed a $1.5 billion loan to the original developers of the Synfuels Plant. The developers defaulted on that loan in 1985, and DOE repaid the lender and took control of the plant. DOE operated the plant from 1985-88, during which time the decision was made to offer the plant for sale through a bidding process. Under the terms of the sales agreement, in order for DOE to recover funds spent to repay the defaulted loan, the buyer, Dakota Gasification Company, agreed to share revenue from gas sales with DOE through 2009. The amount of revenue shared is based on a formula that takes into account natural gas prices and other economic indicators.</p>

The most rapid growth in energy demand will be for nations outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), especially in non-OECD Asia, where strong projected economic growth drives the increase in energy use. Rising oil prices will dampen growth in demand for petroleum and other liquids fuels after 2015, reducing their share of overall energy use from 38 percent in 2004 to a projected 34 percent in 2030. Liquids consumption is still expected to grow strongly, reaching 118 million barrels per day in 2030. The U.S., China, and India together account for nearly half of the projected growth in world liquids use. Coal, with consumption rising at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent, is the fastest-growing energy source worldwide. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, without specific policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, are projected to rise from 26.9 billion metric tons in 2004 to 33.9 billion metric tons in 2015 and 42.9 billion metric tons in 2030.

Put simply, the world needs a technological revolution."</p>
<p><strong>September 25, 2007</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/department-energy-releases-conditional-agreement-new-nuclear-power-plants.html">releases</a> a Conditional Agreement for companies building new nuclear power plants in the U.S. to qualify for a portion of $2 billion in federal risk insurance. Risk insurance covers costs associated with certain regulatory or litigation-related delays-which are no fault of the company-that stall the start-up of these plants. Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct), risk insurance provides incentive and stability in spurring construction of new nuclear power plants and meeting energy needs in a clean, safe, economical manner.</p>
<p><strong>September 25, 2007</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-provide-nearly-20-million-further-development-advanced-batteries-plug-hybrid-electric.html">announces</a> that DOE will invest nearly $20 million in plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) research.

<p><strong>September 27, 2007</strong><br />Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice <a href="http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2007/09/92893.htm" target="_self">opens</a> the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change being held at the State Department. The meeting is attended by <a href="http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/oes/climate/mem/92889.htm" target="_self">representatives</a> from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, United Kingdom, the EU, the EC, and the UN. Using the negotiation leading to the Montreal Protocol Agreement on ozone depleting substances as a model, the Bush Administration's strategy, State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey notes in a <a href="http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2007/sep/92916.htm" target="_self">press briefing</a>, is to avoid a "100 nation-plus context," work with the major economies, which represent over 90 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and come to a "common understanding and a common proposal" to take to "the UN framework."</p>
<p><strong>September 28, 2007</strong><br />President Bush, in <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/09/20070928-2.html" target="_self">remarks</a> to the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change, states that the intent is to finalize the "long-term goal for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions . . . . and other elements of this approach" by summer 2008 and "reach a global consensus at the U.N. in 2009." The President notes that "each nation will design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this long-term goal. These strategies will reflect each country's different energy resources, different stages of development, and different economic needs." The President stresses that "the key to this effort will be the advance of clean energy technologies." He proposes that the participants "join together to create a new international clean technology fund. This fund will be supported by contributions from governments from around the world, and it will help finance clean energy projects in the developing world." The President notes that he has asked Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to coordinate the effort. At the end of the two-day meeting, the White House Council on Environmental Quality issues a <a href="http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/oes/climate/mem/93021.htm" target="_self">summary</a> of the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>September 28, 2007</strong><br />An independent scientific advisory group, the JASON panel, tasked by DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) at the direction of Congress to review the plan for developing the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), issues its <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.fas.org%252Firp%252Fagency%252Fdod%252Fjason%252Frrw.pdf.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">report</a> (pdf). "Certification is not yet assured," notes JASON. "The certification plan presented needs further development. For example, additional experiments and analyses are needed that explore failure modes, and assess the impact on performance of new manufacturing processes. Substantial work remains on the physical understanding of the surety mechanisms that are of high priority to the RRW program. Establishing that the case for confidence in any RRW has been satisfactorily made will require a new peer review process. In addition to certification issues, it is too early to assess how the [RRW] will impact the modernization and streamlining of NNSA's production complex." NNSA praises the report, noting that it confirms that NNSA is "proceeding with appropriate scientific principles." The report, NNSA states, concludes that the "current approach, with additional technical, experimental and peer review enhancements, could determine that RRW can be certified for the stockpile without the need to conduct an underground nuclear test." "I am pleased that the JASON panel feels that we are on the right track," says Thomas D'Agostino, NNSA's administrator.</p>

DOE will not continue the separate use permit contract beyond the current contract with Battelle Memorial Institute. The use permit contract allows Battelle to use laboratory and other resources to pursue work for its own benefit and in direct competition with the private sector. In order to ensure that laboratory resources are dedicated to the public benefit and governmental purposes, this separate contract will not be available to the successor contractor. DOE's decision is based generally on the need to foster competition through a "level playing field" and to better align the new PNNL contract with every other DOE M&amp;O contract.</p>

"This enables DOE to move forward as planned and to submit a high quality license application for the Yucca Mountain repository to the NRC by no later than June 30, 2008," <a href="../articles/statement-ward-sproat-yucca-mountain-director-office-civilian-radioactive-waste-management.html">states</a> Ward Sproat, director of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. "DOE has made electronically available on the NRC's LSN over 3.5 million documents, estimated to exceed 30 million pages."</p>
<p><strong>December 12, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press293.html" target="_self">releases</a> its <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo08/index.html" target="_self"><em>Annual Energy Outlook 2008</em></a>. Current oil prices are above EIA's "reference case projection of long-run prices-driven by shortages of experienced personnel, equipment, and construction materials in the oil industry, political instability in some major producing regions, and recent strong economic growth in developing nations." The EIA states that "it now appears that, in the mid-term, the cost of liquids will be higher than previously projected." World crude oil prices are projected to decline gradually from current levels to $58 per barrel in 2016 (2006 dollars), as expanded investment brings new supplies to the world market. After 2016, real prices rise as higher cost supplies are brought to market. In 2030, the average real price of crude oil is $72 per barrel in 2006 dollars. Secretary Bodman, in a <a href="../articles/statement-secretary-energy-samuel-w-bodman-regarding-eias-updated-annual-energy-outlook.html">statement</a>, says that projections of higher oil prices and increased demand reinforces DOE's "commitment to the development of safe, clean, affordable, and diverse sources of energy."</p>
<p><strong>December 12, 2007</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs-Internal Troops (MVS-IT) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/upgrades-complete-russian-nuclear-protective-force-training-center" target="_self">celebrate</a> the opening of the newly upgraded Lunevo Protective Force Training Center near Moscow. The center, renovated under a successful cost-sharing effort between NNSA and MVD-IT, acts as the primary facility for training protective forces that guard sensitive Russian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p><strong>December 13, 2007</strong><br />The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) holds a Steering Group meeting in Vienna, Austria, where the partners adopt an <a href="http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/GNEP_action_plan.pdf" target="_self">Action Plan</a> (pdf) outlining initial priorities, mechanisms for executing cooperative efforts, and initial milestones for cooperative activities.</p>
<p><strong>December 13, 2007</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/two-independent-assessments-find-department-energys-yucca-mountain-project-track.html">releases</a> two independent assessments addressing areas critical to the overall success of the Yucca Mountain repository program. The assessments, which include an independent review of the Quality Assurance (QA) Program and an independent review of its engineering processes and procedures, conclude that the Yucca Mountain Project's current QA and engineering processes and procedures are consistent with standard nuclear industry practices.</p>
<p><strong>December 13, 2007</strong><br />The Senate passes a revised H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, by a vote of 86 to 8. Removed are a $22 billion tax package that would have cut tax breaks for oil companies and increased support for renewable energy and a mandate that utilities get at least 15 percent of their power generation from nuclear energy.</p>
<p><strong>December 13, 2007</strong><br />The Department's Inspector General issues a <a href="../ig/downloads/special-report-ig-0782.html" target="_self">Special Report</a> (pdf) identifying the most significant management challenges facing DOE: contract management, cyber security, environmental cleanup, human capital management, project management, safeguards and security, and stockpile stewardship.</p>
<p><strong>December 15, 2007</strong><br />The two-week United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Bali, Indonesia, culminates in the adoption of the Bali Roadmap, consisting of a number of "forward-looking decisions" that represent the various tracks for "reaching a secure climate future." The roadmap includes the <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Funfccc.int%252Fresource%252Fdocs%252F2007%252Fcop13%252Feng%252F06a01.pdf.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Bali Action Plan</a> (pdf), which charts the course for a new negotiating process designed to tackle climate change, with the aim of completing this by 2009. The White House issues a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071215-1.html" target="_self">statement</a> noting that the "consensus Decision of the Conference" is a "critical first step in assuring that the UN negotiation process moves forward toward a comprehensive and effective post-2012 arrangement" and has many features that are "quite positive, including those provisions recognizing the importance of developing clean technologies, financing the deployment of those technologies in the developing world, assisting countries in adapting to climate change, exploring industry sector agreements on emissions, and addressing deforestation." The White House nonetheless has "serious concerns" that Bali, in three ways, has not "fully given effect to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities." The negotiations must 1) "proceed on the view that the problem of climate change cannot be adequately addressed through commitments for emissions cuts by developed countries alone," 2) "clearly differentiate among developing countries in terms of the size of their economies, their level of emissions and level of energy utilization, and sufficiently link the character or extent of responsibility to such factors," and 3) "distinguish among developing countries by recognizing that the responsibilities of the smaller or least developed countries are different from the larger, more advanced developing countries."</p>
<p><strong>December 17, 2007</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/nnsa-partners-singapore-secure-seaport-cargo" target="_self">announces</a> that the U.S. and Singapore will cooperate in enhancing existing efforts to scan U.S.-bound cargo and help prevent the illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological material. The Port of Singapore is one of the largest transshipment ports in the world.</p>
<p><strong>December 17, 2007</strong><br />The House approves H.R. 2764, an omnibus $554-billion spending bill combining Fiscal Year 2008 funding for 14 departments, including DOE.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />President Bush <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071218-3.html" target="_self">approves</a> a significant reduction in the nuclear weapons stockpile to take effect by the end of 2007. The President's decision, made on the recommendation of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary Bodman, follows a major reduction previously announced in 2004. As a result, the nuclear stockpile will be less than one-quarter its size at the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />The FutureGen Alliance <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.futuregenalliance.org%252Fpdf%252Fpr_12-18-07.pdf.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">announces</a> (pdf) that the Mattoon, Illinois, site has been selected as its preferred site for the world's first coal-based power plant that removes and sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2) while it produces electricity and hydrogen. FutureGen is a government-industry cost-shared project. "As the Department of Energy has discussed with the FutureGen Alliance for the past several months, projected cost overruns require a reassessment of FutureGen's design," DOE's Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy James Slutz says in a <a href="../articles/statement-us-department-energy-acting-principal-deputy-assistant-secretary-fossil-energy.html">statement</a>. "DOE has not yet issued the Record of Decision (RoD), which is required to enable a final siting determination." He adds that "further details on the structure of FutureGen will be provided next month."</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/energy-department-awards-667-million-large-scale-carbon-sequestration-project.html">awards</a> $66.7 million to the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC) for DOE's fourth large-scale carbon sequestration project. The Partnership led by the Illinois State Geological Survey will conduct large volume tests in the Illinois Basin to demonstrate the ability of a geologic formation to safely, permanently, and economically store more than one million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/nnsa-releases-draft-plan-transform-nuclear-weapons-complex" target="_self">announces</a>, as part of a draft <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.complextransformationspeis.com%252Fproject.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement</a> (SPEIS), its Complex Transformation proposal (formerly referred to as Complex 2030) to create a nuclear weapons infrastructure that is "smaller, safer, more secure and more cost effective." The plan for a future complex would: consolidate special nuclear materials at five sites by the end of 2012; close or transfer from weapons activities about 600 buildings or structures, many by 2010; cease NNSA operations of two major testing sites by 2015; reduce the square footage of buildings and structures supporting weapons missions by as much as one-third, going from greater than 35 million to less than 26 million square feet; employ 20-30% fewer workers directly supporting weapons missions consistent with a smaller, more efficient complex; dismantle weapons at a significantly faster pace.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />The National Academy of Public Administration releases its management review report (pdf) of DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM). The 19-month study-conducted at the request of the House and Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittees-finds that EM is facing a "significant mismatch between the work EM has been asked to perform and the staff resources required to perform it." DOE Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management James Rispoli issues a <a href="../articles/statement-doe-assistant-secretary-environmental-management-james-rispoli-national-academy.html">statement</a> and holds a media availability.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />The House approves the Senate version of H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, by a vote of 314 to 100. Key provisions in the 822-page bill include 1) the first increase in vehicle fuel economy standards (CAFE) in more than 30 years, with automakers required to raise fleet wide gas mileage by 40 percent to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020, 2) a mandatory Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requiring fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022, a nearly five-fold increase over current levels, and 3) improved standards for appliances and lighting, with the sale of most incandescent light bulbs eliminated by 2014. The White House releases a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071218-8.html" target="_self">Fact Sheet</a> stating that the bill responds to President Bush's "Twenty in Ten" vision.</p>
<p><strong>December 18, 2007</strong><br />The Senate approves H.R. 2764, the omnibus Fiscal Year 2008 spending bill. At $24.378 billion, DOE's funding is $362 million less than the FY 2008 request. Programs funded at considerably less than requested include Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, funded at $388 million versus a requested $495 million, and the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, the technology development element of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), funded at $179 million versus a requested $395 million. The Office of Science is funded at $3,973 million versus a requested $4,398 million, with the ITER program receiving only $10.6 million from a $160 million request. Congress provides $1,722 million for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs versus a request $1,236 million. Congress declines to provide the $145 million requested for the planned doubling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 1.5 billion barrels. Congress, in addition, authorizes DOE to issue loan guarantees for advanced clean energy technologies up to a total of $38.5 billion through FY 2011. $20.0 billion will be available through FY 2010 to support eligible projects other than nuclear power facilities. The remaining $18.5 billion will be available through FY 2011 to support nuclear power facilities.</p>
<p><strong>December 19, 2007</strong><br />President Bush, in a ceremony at DOE's Forrestal building in Washington, DC, signs the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. In his <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071219-6.html" target="_self">remarks</a>, the President says that the bill will "address our vulnerabilities and our dependence" on foreign oil in two important ways: 1) by increasing the supply of alternative fuel sources and 2) by reducing demand for oil by increasing fuel economy standards.
