<p><strong>January 2, 2008 </strong><br />Crude oil prices briefly rise above $100 a barrel before closing at $99.62 a barrel. The new record high is close to the inflation-adjusted record of $102.81 set in April 1980. The White House <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080102.html" target="_self">says</a> that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) will not be tapped to bring down prices. "This President would not use the [SPR] to manipulate [prices] unless there was a true emergency," states White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. "Right now we understand that prices are high and demand is extremely high." Perino says the President is focused on ways to increase oil supply. "Doing a temporary release of the SPRO is not going to change prices very much," she notes. "We know that from past history."</p>
<p><strong>January 3, 2008</strong><br />The Department of Energy (DOE) <a href="../articles/doe-cites-battelle-memorial-institute-price-anderson-violations.html">issues</a> a Preliminary Notice of Violation (PNOV) to the Battelle Memorial Institute for nuclear safety violations at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington. Battelle is the managing and operating contractor for PNNL. The PNOV relates to two radiological events that occurred at PNNL, one in December 2006, the other in June 2007. The proposed civil penalty of $288,750 is based on the significance of the violations, yet reflects substantial mitigation granted by DOE due to corrective actions taken by Battelle to address the issues and prevent recurrence. The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 authorizes DOE to undertake regulatory actions against contractors for violations of its nuclear safety requirements.</p>
<p><strong>January 3, 2008</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press294.html" target="_self">announces</a> that it will update projections of U.S. energy demand and supply through 2030 in the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo08/index.html" target="_self"><em>Annual Energy Outlook 2008</em></a> released on December 12, 2007, to reflect the provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed into law on December 19, 2007. "The Congress has passed, and the President has signed, energy legislation containing many provisions that will significantly impact both the level and mix of energy produced and consumed in the U.S. over the next 25 years," notes Guy Caruso, EIA's Administrator. Initial review of the new law by EIA staff suggests that new fuel economy standards for motor vehicles, the mandate for a substantial increase in the use of biofuels, and new efficiency standards for appliances and lighting are likely to have particularly important impacts on energy projections.</p>
<p><strong>January 4, 2008</strong><br />Twenty leaders in the U.S. fusion community, including Ned Sauthoff, project manager of the U.S. Contributions to ITER Project at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, send a <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.aip.org%252Ffyi%252F2008%252F004.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">letter</a> to Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John Marburger, Secretary Bodman, and key congressional committee chairmen urging that funding be provided for continued U.S. participation in ITER.</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, in a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080107-7.html" target="_self">speech</a> to the Union League Club of Chicago, discusses high energy prices. "There is no quick fix," the President notes. "We ought to be exploring for more oil and gas in the United States of America, and I'm convinced we can do so in environmentally friendly ways. And the truth of the matter is, if we're deeply concerned about the environment and want to make sure we're wealthy enough to deal with environmental challenges, we ought to be using nuclear power."</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2008</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.07.08" target="_self">announces</a> that it has removed another shipment of nuclear weapons grade plutonium from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California to DOE's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The shipment is part of an accelerated effort announced last month to remove nuclear material from LLNL by 2012-two years earlier than planned when the first shipment of plutonium left LLNL in late 2006. Similar actions are underway at other nuclear weapons complex sites.</p>
<p><strong>January 9, 2008</strong><br />The Department's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <a href="http://www.pnl.gov/topstory.asp?id=285" target="_self">announces</a> the results of the Pacific Northwest GridWise Demonstration Project, a year-long effort that used advanced technologies to enable consumers to be active participants in improving power grid efficiency and reliability while saving money. The project involved two separate studies to test demand-response concepts and technologies. The Olympic Peninsula Project found homeowners are willing to adjust their individual energy use based on price signals-provided via information technology tools. The Grid Friendly Appliance Project demonstrated that everyday household appliances can automatically reduce energy consumption at critical moments when they are fitted with controllers that sense stress on the grid. Both studies helped reduce pressure on the grid during times of peak demand.</p>
<p><strong>January 10, 2008</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-selects-savannah-river-nuclear-solutions-llc-manage-and-operate-its-savannah-river-site.html">announces</a> that Savannah River Nuclear Solutions (SRNS), LLC, has been selected as the management and operating contractor for DOE's Savannah River Site (SRS) in Aiken, South Carolina. The contract is a cost-plus award-fee contract valued at approximately $800 million per year and is for a five-year base period with the option to extend it for up to five additional years. The SRS management and operating contract includes three key mission areas: environmental cleanup, operation of the Savannah River National Laboratory, and National Nuclear Security Administration activities. SRNS is a limited liability corporation consisting of Fluor Federal Services, Inc., Honeywell International, Inc., and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (a Northrop Grumman Company).</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2008</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.11.08" target="_self">announces</a> the availability of a draft <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.complextransformationspeis.com%252Fproject.html" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement</a> (SPEIS). The SPEIS evaluates NNSA's proposal for continuing the transformation of the nuclear weapons complex, along with a range of reasonable alternatives. NNSA's objective is to create a nuclear weapons infrastructure that is smaller, safer, more secure, and less expensive. Nineteen public hearings will be held across the country.</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on a multi-nation tour of the Middle East, views a model of the proposed Masdar City, a planned green, sustainable community of 25,000 people, which will be fully solar-powered and use light rail for transportation. The President notes that city based "entirely upon renewable energy. . . . will be an opportunity to see what works and what won't work, and an opportunity to share their technology with others."</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/deputy-secretary-energy-clay-sell-depart.html">announces</a> the resignation of Deputy Secretary Clay Sell. The Deputy Secretary's resignation will be effective February 29.</p>
<p><strong>January 14, 2008</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/01.14.08" target="_self">announces</a> that the first new boiler and turbine of a fossil fuel power plant it is refurbishing is up and running in the city of Seversk in Siberia, marking a major milestone in a nonproliferation project to shut down two weapons-grade plutonium production reactors in Russia. The fossil fuel power plant will provide heat and electricity so that two of the three remaining Russian reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium can be shut down, effectively eliminating the production of 800 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium per year.</p>
<p><strong>January 15, 2008</strong><br />President Bush <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080116-1.html" target="_self">discusses</a> energy issues with King Abdullah and Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Participating in a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080114-2.html" target="_self">Roundtable</a> with Saudi Entrepreneurs, he states that he has discussed with officials "the fact that oil prices are very high, which is tough on our economy, and that I would hope, as OPEC considers different production levels, that they understand that if their-one of their biggest consumers' economy suffers, it will mean less purchases, less oil and gas sold." Later at a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080115-1.html" target="_self">press conference</a>, he notes that "there is not a lot of excess capacity in the marketplace. What's happened is, is that demand for energy has outstripped new supply. And that's why there's high price. And I fully understand how it affects the U.S. consumer." The President says that he hopes that "OPEC, if possible, understands that if they could put more supply on the market it would be helpful. But a lot of . . . these oil-producing countries are full out."</p>
<p><strong>January 15, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman and Department of Agriculture (USDA) Acting Secretary Chuck Conner <a href="../articles/usda-and-doe-biomass-research-and-development-technical-advisory-committee-members.html">announce</a> the appointment of six new members and the reappointment of seven members to serve on its Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory Committee for a term of three years. The Committee was established by the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 to assist USDA and DOE in meeting important national goals for a healthier rural economy and improved national energy security.</p>
<p><strong>January 15, 2008</strong><br />The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, established by Congress in 2005, issues its <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fmtcfilehost.net%252Ftransportationfortomorrow%252Ffinal_report%252Findex.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_self">final report</a>. In order to adequately fund future surface transportation investments, the commission recommends that the federal gas tax be increased from 5 to 8 cents per gallon per year over the next 5 years, after which it should be indexed to inflation.</p>
<p><strong>January 16, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-travel-middle-east-advance-international-energy-cooperation.html">departs</a> on a five-nation tour to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt. The purpose of the trip is to enhance the U.S. relationship with oil-producing nations, promote sustained investment in conventional and alternative energy sources, and encourage improvements in global energy efficiency. On his return, the Secretary plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>January 17, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-meets-jordanian-prime-minister-tout-role-energy-diversity.html">meets</a> with Jordan's Prime Minister Nader al-Dahabi in Amman, Jordan, and discusses the growing energy cooperation between the two nations aimed at increasing global energy security. "The U.S. and Jordan have a strong and growing relationship in advancing global energy security," the Secretary says. "Cutting-edge energy technologies such as those being developed in Jordan complement efforts underway in the United States to harness scientific innovation to provide greater energy options." Afterwards, the Secretary discusses high energy prices with reporters. "The reason that the price of oil is increasing is in part due to the fact that there is a perceived shortage," the Secretary notes. "In my own view, there is some evidence to suggest that the supplies are less than what we would like to see them."</p>
<p><strong>January 17, 2008</strong><br />The Department's Office of Science <a href="../articles/doe-awards-265-million-hours-supercomputing-time-advance-leading-scientific-research.html">announces</a> that 55 projects were awarded a total of 265 million hours of computing time on some of the world's most powerful supercomputers located at DOE facilities as part of its 2008 Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program. This is the largest amount of supercomputing resource awards ever donated and three times that awarded in 2007. The supercomputers will allow cutting-edge research and design of virtual prototypes to be carried out in weeks or months, rather than the years or decades that would be needed using conventional computing systems. The projects-with applications from aeronautics to astrophysics, and from climate change to combustion research-were chosen based on their potential breakthroughs in the science and engineering research and their suitability of the project for using supercomputers. Launched in 2003, the INCITE mission is to advance American science and industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p><strong>January 17, 2008</strong><br />Under Secretary Bud Albright, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, <a href="../articles/department-energy-invest-30-million-accelerate-development-and-deployment-plug-hybrid.html">announces</a> that: 1) DOE will invest up to $30 million for cost-shared development and demonstration projects supporting Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles (PHEVs), and 2) DOE will participate in the U.S. Automotive Partnership for Advancing Research &amp; Technologies-or USAutoPARTs-a cooperative alliance between the State of Michigan and the original auto parts suppliers industry. The $30 million is for projects to improve battery performance so vehicles can deliver up to 40 miles of electric range without recharging, and address critical barriers to achieving DOE's goal of making PHEVs cost-competitive by 2014 and ready for commercialization by 2016. USAutoPARTs will perform pre-competitive research and development and engage auto suppliers to advance cost-effective emerging technologies into performance-specified, factory-ready materials, processes, components and systems.</p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-travels-saudi-arabia-discuss-global-energy-investments.html">continues</a> his six-nation visit to the Middle East and Europe with a two-day stop in Saudi Arabia where he meets with Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Ibrahim Al-Naimi to discuss joint energy cooperation. The Secretary praises Saudi efforts to enhance, protect, and modernize its energy infrastructure and discusses Saudi Arabia's plans to expand oil production capacity.</p>
<p><strong>January 21, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/secretary-bodman-highlights-alternative-energy-cooperation-united-arab-emirates.html">visits</a> the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he delivers <a href="../articles/keynote-remarks-masdarworld-future-energy-conference.html">keynote remarks</a> at the Masdar World Future Energy Summit 2008 emphasizing the importance of innovation in securing safe, reliable, affordable, and diverse energy supplies. On the sidelines of the energy summit, the Secretary tells reporters that OPEC should increase the supply of oil. "We are hopeful that they will increase supplies," the Secretary notes.

<p><strong>January 30, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/doe-announces-restructured-futuregen-approach-demonstrate-ccs-technology-multiple-clean.html">announces</a> a restructured approach to its FutureGen project that aims to demonstrate cutting-edge carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology at multiple commercial-scale Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) clean coal power plants as opposed to the concept announced in 2003 of building a single near-zero emissions, 275 MW power plant that produced hydrogen and electricity from coal on a smaller-than-commercial-scale. The restructured approach will focus on separating carbon dioxide (CO2) for CCS and does not include hydrogen production. The multiple plants will be operational by 2015. DOE's investment will provide funding for no more than the CCS component of the power plant-not the entire plant construction, compared with the 2003 concept where the federal government would incur 74 percent of rising costs. "This restructured FutureGen approach is an all-around better investment for Americans," notes the Secretary. "As technological advancements have been realized in the last five years, we are eager to demonstrate CCS technology on commercial plants that when operational, will be the cleanest coal-fired plants in the world."</p>

<p><strong>February 28, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, at a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080228-2.html" target="_self">press conference</a>, is asked to respond to the prediction by some analysts that the price of gasoline will reach $4 a gallon in the spring. The President responds that he had not heard that but the price of gas is "high now." He notes that "energy policy needs to be focused on a lot of things"-including renewables and conservation. He observes that the price of corn used to produce ethanol is going up and is affecting the price of food, but "research and development . . . will enable us to use other raw material to produce ethanol." This is a "transitory period to new technologies," the President says, but "we need to be finding more oil and gas at home if we're worried about becoming dependent on oil overseas."</p>
<p><strong>February 28, 2008</strong><br />The Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/02.28.08" target="_self">announces</a> that special nuclear material quantities requiring the highest level of security protection have been removed from DOE's Sandia National Laboratories. The move completes the first phase in NNSA's efforts to consolidate special nuclear material at five sites by 2012. Sandia National Laboratories is the first NNSA site to reduce its on-site inventory of nuclear materials below the level requiring "category I and II" protection. These security categories require the highest level of security to protect material that includes plutonium and highly enriched uranium.</p>
<p><strong>February 28, 2008</strong><br />Deputy Secretary Sell-one day before leaving DOE-tells a reporter that the Department is considering a plan under which a government-chartered, TVA-like corporation would take over DOE's nuclear waste program. The corporation would assume the responsibility of developing the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository and pursue other options for dealing with spent nuclear fuel, including reprocessing. "That's an idea," the Deputy Secretary notes, "that's been around for a long time, and I think it has a lot of attractive things about it. We've thought about it on numerous occasions. We continue to think about it."</p>
<p><strong>February 28, 2008</strong><br />The Department's Idaho National Laboratory (INL) <a href="https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1555&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_110102" target="_self">awards</a> a contract to Eagle Rock Timber of Idaho Falls to build a new radiochemistry laboratory (RCL) at the Materials and Fuels Complex on the INL desert site. Groundbreaking is scheduled this spring with the facility slated to open in February 2009. The laboratory is estimated to cost $5 million and will consolidate activities from existing laboratories.</p>

<p><strong>March 4, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, holding a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080304-1.html" target="_self">press availability</a> following a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan, speaks about the likelihood of the OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) meeting of ministers in Vienna holding production output steady. "If I were a member of OPEC, I'd be concerned about high energy prices causing people to buy less energy over time," the President says. High energy prices "stimulate alternative fuels, which we're doing a lot here in America. We're spending a lot of money on biofuels and ethanols and new ways to make ethanol. My advice to OPEC-of course they haven't listened to it-but my advice to OPEC is to understand the consequences of high energy prices."</p>
<p><strong>March 4, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman and Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Ed Schafer <a href="../articles/usda-doe-invest-184-million-biomass-research-development-and-demonstration-projects.html">announce</a>, in <a href="../articles/washington-international-renewable-energy-conference.html">remarks</a> at the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference 2008 (WIREC), that DOE and USDA combined will invest up to $18.4 million, over three years, for 21 biomass research and development (R&amp;D), and demonstration projects. These projects specifically aim to address critical barriers to making production of biomass more efficient and cost-effective and bring online more clean, bio-based products and biofuels.</p>
<p><strong>March 4, 2008</strong><br />Guy Caruso, administrator of DOE's Energy Information Administration, <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/speeches/caruso030408.pdf" target="_self">testifies</a> (pdf) on the long-term outlook for energy markets in the U.S. before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He projects that real world crude oil prices will decline gradually from current levels to $57 per barrel in 2016, as expanded investment in exploration and development brings new supplies to the world market. After 2016, real prices begin to rise, as demand continues to grow and higher cost supplies are brought to market. In 2030, the average real price of crude oil is $70 per barrel in 2006 dollars. Caruso also tells the committee that DOE's ongoing filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the current high-price environment is raising global oil prices by about $2 per barrel.</p>
<p><strong>March 4, 2008</strong><br />The Department's Oak Ridge National Laboratory releases a report on "Biofuel Feedstock Assessment for Selected Countries" (pdf). The report projects that Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and members of the Caribbean Basin Initiative could produce sufficient feedstock for more than 30 billion gallons of ethanol per year by 2017, which would represent a six-fold increase over current production. Nearly 40 percent of the projected supply in 2017 is based on the potential to use new technology to produce advanced biofuels from cellulosic feedstock using crop residues and forestry byproducts.</p>
<p><strong>March 5, 2008</strong><br />The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.opec.org%252Fopec_web%252Fen%252F961.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_self">meeting</a> in Vienna, decides to maintain current production levels. OPEC observes that "the market is well-supplied, with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five-year average." OPEC "further noted, with concern, that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals, as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the US dollar, rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market." In response, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino says President Bush is "disappointed" at OPEC's decision not to boost output. Secretary Bodman notes that the U.S. and OPEC have different views on speculation. "They see speculation in the market. I see a decline in global inventories." The Secretary adds that there is "really nothing" that the U.S. can do to bring down short-term oil prices but to lobby OPEC and other producers to increase supplies.</p>
<p><strong>March 5, 2008</strong><br />President Bush <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080305.html" target="_self">addresses</a> the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference 2008 (WIREC). The President tells the audience that they are "pioneers on the frontiers of change" and that within a decade "people will marvel about how far technology has helped change our habits and change the world." He discusses the importance of renewable and alternative energy technologies to increasing America's energy security and addressing the long-term challenge of global climate change. "America has got to change its habits," the President says. "We've got to get off oil."</p>
<p><strong>March 5, 2008</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-plans-supplemental-environmental-impact-statement-new-petroleum-reserve-site.html">announces</a> plans to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve expansion site in Richton, Mississippi.

High energy prices, the President notes, are "like a tax increase on the working people" with gas prices having gone up by $1.40 per gallon over the past 18 months. "I've repeatedly submitted proposals to help address these problems," he observes. "Yet time after time, Congress chose to block them. . . . Instead of increasing costs and increasing new roadblocks to domestic energy production, Congress needs to clear away obstacles to more affordable, more reliable energy here at home." The press then asks the President questions on implementing a summer gas tax moratorium, persuading Saudi Arabia to reconsider output levels during his upcoming visit, the relationship between high food prices and biofuels, whether the world is closing in on peak oil production, increasing calls to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and short-term solutions to high energy prices.</p>

The EIA reports that oil prices "increased from $101 to $120 per barrel over the first 3 weeks of April as supply disruptions in Nigeria and the North Sea and continuing strong demand growth in the emerging market countries pressured oil markets. Prices, which averaged $72 per barrel in 2007, are projected to average $110 per barrel in 2008 and $103 per barrel in 2009. These projections are about $9 per barrel higher than the projections in April's <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/forecasting/steo/oldsteos/apr08.pdf" target="_self"><em>Outlook</em></a> (pdf). The EIA notes that the "oil supply system continues to operate at near capacity and remains vulnerable to both actual and perceived supply disruptions. . . . The combination of rising global demand, fairly normal seasonal inventory patterns, slow gains in non-OPEC supply, and low levels of available surplus production capacity is providing firm support for prices."</p>
<p><strong>May 7, 2008</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-takes-next-steps-restructured-futuregen-approach.html">releases</a> a draft Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to solicit public input on the demonstration of multiple commercial-scale Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) or other clean coal power plants with cutting-edge carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology under DOE's restructured FutureGen approach.

<p><strong>May 7, 2008</strong><br />The price of oil closes at a record $123.53 per barrel. Democrats in Congress unveil the Consumers First Energy Act. Provisions include a 25 percent windfall profits tax on oil companies, a rollback of existing tax breaks for oil and gas companies worth $17 billion over 10 years, an authorization for the U.S. attorney general to bring price collusion charges against OPEC members, and a suspension of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until the price of crude oil fell back to $75 a barrel. "The Bush administration's oil-friendly policies have led us down the path of the most significant energy crisis we have had in decades," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) tells reporters. Republicans offer a counter proposal that would increase U.S. oil production by opening protected areas on the Outer Continental Shelf and in Alaska to oil and gas drilling. "Americans don't need more taxes and more investigations. They need more oil and lower prices," says Senator Pete V. Domenici (R-NM). "Yet nothing in the Democrats' plan will produce a single drop of oil."</p>

<p><strong>June 9, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, as he is about to depart on an eight-day trip to Europe, <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080609-1.html" target="_self">tells</a> the press that one of the major issues for discussion is that "we're all too dependent on hydrocarbons" and "we must work to advance technologies to help us become less dependent." Noting that he will remind "our friends and allies" that the U.S has an opportunity to help increase the supply of oil on the market and take "pressure off gasoline for hardworking Americans," the President says that he has "proposed to the Congress that they open up ANWR, open up the Continental Shelf, and give this country a chance to help us through this difficult period by finding more supplies of crude oil, which will take the pressure off the price of gasoline."</p>
<p><strong>June 9, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman <a href="../articles/us-department-energys-new-supercomputer-fastest-world.html">announces</a> that the new Roadrunner supercomputer, a collaborative effort between DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and IBM, is the fastest in the world. In a test run on May 27, Roadrunner achieved a long-sought supercomputing goal: performing more than a thousand trillion operations per second, or one petaflop. Roadrunner, to be housed at LANL, will be used to perform calculations that vastly improve the ability to certify that the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile is reliable without conducting underground nuclear tests.</p>

<p><strong>June 18, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, joined by Secretary Bodman and Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne, discusses <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618-9.html" target="_self">energy issues</a> in <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html" target="_self">remarks</a> in the White House Rose Garden. The President calls on Congress "to move forward with four steps to expand American oil and gasoline production": 1) lift the legislative ban on oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf, 2) remove the provision inserted in the Fiscal Year 2007 omnibus spending bill blocking oil shale leasing on federal lands and thus "expand oil production by tapping into the extraordinary potential of oil shale," 3) permit oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and 4) pass measures the President is proposing to expedite the refinery permitting process and thus "expand and enhance" refining capacity. "The proposals I've outlined will take years to have their full impact," the President notes, but "there is no excuse for delay. . . . If congressional leaders leave for the 4th of July recess without taking action, they will need to explain why $4-a-gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act. And Americans will rightly ask how high oil -- how high gas prices have to rise before the Democratic-controlled Congress will do something about it."</p>
<p><strong>June 18, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman, in an interview on CNBC, says that high prices will not persuade him to recommend tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. "The reserve is meant to be a protection for the American consuming public," the Secretary notes. "It was never meant to be a tool to combat high prices. So this is not something that I would intend, whatever price oil achieves, that I would recommend to the president that he make that judgment."</p>

The report projects that world marketed energy consumption, driven by robust economic growth and expanding populations in the world's developing countries, will grow by 50 percent between 2005 and 2030. Although liquid fuels are expected to remain the largest single source of energy through 2030, the liquids share of marketed world energy consumption declines from 37 percent in 2005 to 33 percent in 2030. In addition, the share of conventional oil in the overall liquids supply declines with expanded use of unconventional oil, biofuels, and other unconventional liquids. Coal's share of world energy, which has increased sharply over the past few years, is likely to grow unless there are significant changes in existing laws and policies, particularly those related to greenhouse gas emissions. Coal accounted for 24 percent of total world energy use in 2002 and 27 percent in 2005. Coal's share of total world energy consumption is projected to reach 29 percent by 2030.</p>

Dan Price, Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs and Deputy National Security Advisor, <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080708-4.html" target="_self">tells</a> the press it was "an excellent discussion and an excellent declaration" and cites "significant progress in . . . four very important respects": 1) agreement that the U.N. Convention on Climate Change should consider and adopt a goal of reducing emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 and recognition that all "major economies" must commit to meaningful midterm mitigation actions; 2) agreement that progress towards ambitious emission reduction goals can only be achieved through accelerated adoption of existing technologies and development and deployment of a new generation of technologies; 3) commitments of more than $5 billion to support the Clean Technology Fund that will lower the cost of financing clean energy projects in developing countries; and 4) endorsement of the Major Economies effort on climate change.</p>
<p><strong>July 9, 2008</strong><br />President Bush and other Major Economies leaders meet at Toyako, Japan, and issue a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080709-5.html" target="_self">Declaration on Energy Security and Climate Change</a>. The declaration calls for "ambitious, realistic, and achievable" steps for "enhanced greenhouse gas mitigation." It states that it would be "desirable" for all countries to adopt an ambitious long-term global goal for greenhouse gas emissions reduction that assures growth and prosperity. The declaration commits the "developed major economies" to taking actions in the mid-term to halt the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and achieve absolute emission reductions, while the "developing major economies" will take actions in the mid-term to achieve a "deviation from business-as-usual emissions." James Connaughton, Chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality, <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080709-3.html" target="_self">briefs</a> the press, noting that the President in his remarks called it a "historic gathering" with leaders of the major economies for the first time meeting specifically to discuss these issues. Connaughton adds that four meetings of their "direct personal representatives" led up to the leaders meeting. He says that it is important that the leaders "recognized what the G8 also articulated yesterday, that achieving an ambitious long-term goal depends on significant advances in technology and the infrastructure to deliver that technology in all of our countries." The White House issues a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080709-6.html" target="_self">Fact Sheet</a> on the meeting, and President Bush delivers <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080709-4.html" target="_self">remarks</a> summing up the G8 Summit and the Major Economies Leaders Meeting.</p>

<p><strong>July 11, 2008</strong><br />Secretary Bodman hosts President Bush and his "economic team" at the DOE headquarters Forrestal building. Following the meeting, the President <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080711-4.html" target="_self">tells</a> reporters that Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, Jr., briefed the group on financial markets and economic stimulus payments. "The problem, of course, is that gasoline prices are up," notes the President. "And one of the main reasons why gasoline prices are up is because crude oil prices are up. And one reason crude oil prices are up is because demand is outstripping supply. And therefore, what can we do about it? . . . And one of the things we just went through was a briefing from Secretary Bodman and Secretary Kempthorne about the vast potential of crude oil reserves on offshore lands, as well as in Alaska, as well as in the oil shale in the western part of our country." The President adds that the "other part of our briefing was how we could explore in environmentally friendly ways. Technology has changed dramatically to enable the exploitation of oil in a way that protects the environment."</p>
<p><strong>July 11, 2008</strong><br />The price of oil reaches an intraday record of $147.27 a barrel before closing at $145.08.</p>
<p><strong>July 12, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, in his weekly <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080712.html" target="_self">radio address</a>, discusses high gas prices. The President says that Congress should "work together" with his administration "on four steps that will expand American oil and gas production and eventually relieve the pressure of rising prices": 1) expand American oil production by increasing access to offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf, 2) expand oil production by tapping into the "extraordinary potential" of oil shale, 3) expand American oil production by permitting exploration in northern Alaska, and 4) expand and enhance our refining capacity.</p>
<p><strong>July 13, 2008</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-commits-850000-support-nga-energy-initiatives.html">announces</a> that it will provide $850,000 this fiscal year to support the National Governors Association's work to enact energy policies at the state level that will help develop and deploy cleaner sources of energy to power America's vehicles, homes, and workplaces more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>July 14, 2008</strong><br />President Bush, in <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-4.html" target="_self">remarks</a> delivered in the White House Rose Garden, announces that he is lifting the executive prohibition on oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf. The President again calls on Congress to lift the "legislative ban and allow the exploration and development of offshore oil resources." He states that "now the ball is squarely in Congress' court. Democratic leaders can show that they have finally heard the frustrations of the American people by matching the action I've taken today, repealing the congressional ban, and passing legislation to facilitate responsible offshore exploration. This legislation must allow states to have a say in what happens off their shores, provide a way for the federal government and states to share new leasing revenues, and ensure the environment is protected." The White House also issues a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-7.html" target="_self">Fact Sheet</a>, and Press Secretary Dana Perino discusses the issue in her <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-5.html" target="_self">press briefing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>July 14, 2008</strong><br />The Department <a href="../articles/doe-provide-40-million-funding-small-scale-biorefinery-projects-wisconsin-and-louisiana.html">announces</a> the selection of two small-scale cellulosic biorefinery projects in Park Falls, Wisconsin, and Jennings, Louisiana, for federal funding of up to $40 million over five years. These small-scale facilities will input approximately 70 tons of feedstock per day and produce 1.5 to 6 million gallons a year of liquid transportation fuels such as cellulosic ethanol from wood, energy crops and agricultural waste products.</p>
<p><strong>July 15, 2008</strong><br />President Bush leads off his <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080715-1.html" target="_self">press conference</a> by noting that "it's been a difficult time for many American families who are coping with declining housing values and high gasoline prices." The President says that "to help address the pressure on gasoline prices my administration took action this week to clear the way for offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf." He renews his call for Congress to remove the ban. When asked what "short-term advice" he would offer to Americans, the President replies "obviously good conservation measures matter," but he adds that "there is no short-term solution. . . . the President doesn't have a magic wand. You just can't say, low gas. It took us a while to get here and we need to have a good strategy to get out of it." The President responds to four additional questions from the press on energy issues.</p>

The report finds that if hydrogen vehicles take over the market there would be significant decreases in both oil consumption and greenhouse gas emission, although emissions reductions would depend upon how the hydrogen fuel was produced. Comparing these reductions with those achieved by either improving the fuel efficiency of conventional vehicles or by converting to biofuels, the report finds that both could produce reductions in oil use and emissions faster than hydrogen because they can be implemented more rapidly. After about 2040, however, hydrogen becomes more effective. The report urges that all options be pursued simultaneously.</p>

But we believe that the root cause of high energy prices is supply and demand. So while they can have the vote on speculation and they can move forward on that, we think that it is critical that we start focusing on the resources that we have in our own country and the ways that we can access those resources in environmentally friendly ways, including oil shale, offshore oil drilling and opening up a small bit of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling."</p>

<p><strong>December 7, 2008</strong><br />President-elect Obama, in an interview on Meet the Press, states that he is not in favor of raising gasoline taxes. "Putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake, the President-elect says. "What we have to do long term is make sure that we have an energy strategy that focuses on fuel-efficient cars, that focuses on providing incentives for fuel-efficient cars. Same applies to buildings. We have an enormously inefficient building stock, and we can save huge amounts of energy costs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil by simple things like weatherization and changing the lighting in, in major buildings. That's going to be part of our economic recovery plan. It actually allows us to spend some money, put some people to work right away, but it also creates a long-term, sustainable energy future."</p>
