The <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=186635">plan</a> focuses on overcoming three key challenges: the relatively high cost of offshore wind energy; technical challenges surrounding installation, operations, and grid interconnection; and the lack of site data and experience with project permitting processes. Under the plan, DOE is pursuing a scenario that includes deployment 10 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity by 2020 and 54 gigawatts by 2030. Those scenarios include development in both federal and state offshore areas, including along Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts as well as in Great Lakes and Hawaiian waters. Those levels of development would produce enough energy to power 2.8 million and 15.2 million average American homes, respectively. In support of the plan, Secretary Chu announces the release of three solicitations, representing up to $50.5 million over 5 years, to develop breakthrough offshore wind energy technology and to reduce specific market barriers to its deployment. Secretary Salazar also identifies four Wind Energy Areas offshore the mid-Atlantic as part of Interior's 'Smart from the Start' approach announced in November 2010 that uses appropriate designated areas, coordinated environmental studies, large-scale planning, and expedited approval processes to speed offshore wind energy development.</p>

<p><strong>March 11, 2011</strong><br />A magnitude 9.0 earthquake in the Pacific Ocean 130 kilometers east of Japan triggers a tsunami that slams into the Japanese coast. Several nuclear power plants automatically shut down, but early reports indicate a possible nuclear emergency with the chance of reactor meltdowns at nuclear power plants. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex loses its electrical power, but diesel generators continue to delivering power to circulate cooling water. The diesel generators shut down after getting hit by the tsunami, with waves as high as 15 meters. President Obama receives a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/11/president-obama-receives-briefing-earthquake-japan-and-tsunami-preparedn">briefing</a> and issues a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/11/statement-president-earthquake-japan-and-resulting-tsunami-warning-throu">statement</a>. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issues a <a href="http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1107/ML110700697.pdf">press release</a> stating that NRC senior officials are "following events."</p>
<p><strong>March 11, 2011</strong><br />President Obama, at a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/11/news-conference-president">news conference</a>, discusses the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and rising oil and gas prices. "Rising prices are not a new phenomenon," the President notes. "Three years ago, before the recession hit, a combination of factors, including rising demand from emerging economies like China, drove gas prices to more than $4 a gallon. The worldwide recession and the decrease in demand pushed prices back down. But over the past year, as the economy has picked up steam and global demand for oil has increased, prices have increased again. Turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East has added uncertainty to the mix and lost production in Libya has tightened supply." The President states that the "good news" is that the "global community can manage supply disruptions like this. Other oil-producing nations have committed to filling any gaps – and we will continue to coordinate closely with our international partners to keep all options on the table when it comes to any supply disruptions." He adds that "here at home, everybody should know that should the situation demand it, we are prepared to tap the significant stockpile of oil that we have in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve."</p>
<p><strong>March 11, 2011</strong><br />The Governing Board of the International Energy Agency (IEA) <a href="../articles/secretary-comments-selection-next-executive-director-international-energy-agency.html">announces</a> that their 28 members have selected Maria Van der Hoeven of the Netherlands, the former Dutch Minister of the Economy, to be the Agency's next Executive Director. Ms. Van der Hoeven will succeed Nobuo Tanaka of Japan effective September 1, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>March 12, 2011</strong><br />A hydrogen explosion blows the roof off the Unit 1 reactor building at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex as a result of the previous day's earthquake and tsunami. Operators attempt to prevent a nuclear meltdown by injecting sea water into it. Residents within 20 kilometers are evacuated. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission <a href="http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1107/ML110710004.pdf">announces</a> that it is deploying two officials to Japan with expertise in boiling water nuclear reactors.</p>
<p><strong>March 13, 2011</strong><br />Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano states that a partial meltdown in Unit 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex is "highly possible." The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) <a href="http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1107/ML110720002.pdf">announces</a> that it is "coordinating with the Department of Energy and other federal agencies in providing whatever assistance the Japanese government requests." The NRC states that "all the available information indicates weather conditions have taken the small releases from the Fukushima reactors out to sea away from the population. Given the thousands of miles between the two countries, Hawaii, Alaska, the U.S. Territories and the U.S. West Coast are not expected to experience any harmful levels of radioactivity." The NRC adds that measures taken by Japan "appear to be consistent with steps the United States would take."</p>
<p><strong>March 14, 2011</strong><br />The Japanese government formally asks for assistance from the U.S. as it continues to respond to nuclear power plant cooling issues. Falling water levels in Units 1, 2 and 3 expose part of the nuclear fuel. A hydrogen explosion occurs in Unit 3, leaving the spent fuel pool exposed to the atmosphere. The White House releases a <a href="../articles/statement-white-house-press-secretary-ongoing-us-response-earthquakes-and-tsunami-japan.html">statement</a> on the ongoing U.S. response to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, noting that "officials from the Department of Energy, NRC, and other agencies have maintained contact with Japanese officials and will provide whatever assistance the Japanese government requests as they work to stabilize their damaged nuclear reactors."</p>

Noting the rising gas prices and the nation's continuing dependence on foreign oil, the President states that the U.S. "cannot afford to bet our long-term prosperity, our long-term security on a resource that will eventually run out, and even before it runs out will get more and more expensive to extract from the ground. We can’t afford it when the costs to our economy, our country, and our planet are so high. Not when your generation needs us to get this right. It’s time to do what we can to secure our energy future." Declaring that he is setting a "new goal," the President says that "when I was elected to this office, America imported 11 million barrels of oil a day. By a little more than a decade from now, we will have cut that by one-third. That is something that we can achieve." Meeting this goal, he adds, "depends largely on two things: first, finding and producing more oil at home; second, reducing our overall dependence on oil with cleaner alternative fuels and greater efficiency."

"What’s driving oil prices up right now is not the lack of supply," the President notes. "There’s enough supply. There’s enough oil out there for world demand. The problem is, is that oil is sold on these world markets, and speculators and people make various bets, and they say, you know what, we think that maybe there’s a 20 percent chance that something might happen in the Middle East that might disrupt oil supply, so we’re going to bet that oil is going to go up real high. And that spikes up prices significantly. We’re now in a position where we can investigate if there’s unfair speculation. We’re going to be monitoring gas stations to make sure there isn’t any price gouging that’s taking advantage of consumers. But the truth is that it is a world commodity, and when prices spike up like this there aren’t a lot of short-term solutions. What we have are medium- and long-term solutions."</p>

<p><strong>April 26, 2011</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press361.cfm">releases</a> the complete version of <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/archive/aeo11/">Annual Energy Outlook 2011</a>, which includes 57 sensitivity cases that show how different assumptions regarding market, policy, and technology drivers affect the previously released Reference case projections. A key highlight is that U.S. reliance on imported liquid fuels falls due to increased domestic production—including biofuels—and greater fuel efficiency. Although U.S. consumption of liquid fuels continues to grow through 2035 in the Reference case, reliance on petroleum imports as a share of total liquids consumption decreases. Total U.S. consumption of liquid fuels, including both fossil fuels and biofuels, rises from about 18.8 million barrels per day in 2009 to 21.9 million barrels per day in 2035 in the Reference case.

The GAO finds that "DOE’s decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain repository program was made for policy reasons, not technical or safety reasons." The GAO also notes that "concerns have been raised about DOE’s expedited procedures for disposing of property from the program, and its documentation of these procedures was limited. In addition, DOE did not consistently follow federal policy and guidance for planning or assessing risks of the shutdown. Some of these steps to dismantle the program will likely hinder progress if the license application review process resumes—should NRC or the courts require it." In a 14 page letter to the GAO published in the report, DOE "strongly disagrees with many of the conclusions drawn" in the report. "In some areas, those conclusions are based upon misapprehensions of fact. In others, the Draft Report appears to accept on faith assertions by parties who are either ill-informed or have self-interested (for example, financial) reason to disagree with DOE's considered judgments."</p>

The new report reaffirms that the preponderance of scientific evidence points to human activities -- especially the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- as the most likely cause for most of the global warming that has occurred over the last several decades. This trend, according to the report, cannot be explained by natural factors such as internal climate variability or changes in incoming energy from the sun. The report adds that the impacts of climate change on human and natural systems can generally be expected to intensify with warming. The committee concludes that a coordinated national response to climate change, which the country currently lacks, is needed and should be guided by an iterative risk management framework in which actions taken can be revised as new knowledge is gained.</p>

<p><strong>June 21, 2011</strong><br />The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=1890">projects</a> that world oil demand will increase by 1.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2011. The projected increase in global oil demand coincides with non-OPEC supply constraints and the ongoing Libyan production shortfall. As a result, EIA estimates that, after accounting for OPEC non-crude liquids and non-OPEC supply, the call on OPEC crude and inventories will grow by 2.2 million and 1.4 million bb/d in the third and fourth quarters of 2011, respectively, from the second-quarter levels. Higher production from the rest of OPEC will be required to meet demand growth and replace significant amounts of Libyan supply through the end of 2012 due to the Libyan oil supply disruption. Crude oil prices reached their highest level of the year at the end of April, the EIA notes, but fell by over 10 percent by mid-June. Despite the recent fall in crude oil and gasoline prices, oil markets are more likely to tighten than soften in the short term.</p>

<p><strong>October 6, 2011</strong><br />President Obama, in response to a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/06/news-conference-president">news conference</a> question on the Solyndra bankruptcy and the DOE loan guarantee program, says that Solyndra "is a loan guarantee program that predates me that historically has had support from Democrats and Republicans as well. And the idea is pretty straightforward: If we are going to be able to compete in the 21st century, then we’ve got to dominate cutting-edge technologies, we’ve got to dominate cutting-edge manufacturing. Clean energy is part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States if we’re going to be able to succeed." He adds that "the Department of Energy made these decisions based on their best judgment about what would make sense. And the nature of these programs are going to be ones in which for every success there may be one that does not work out as well. But that’s exactly what the loan guarantee program was designed by Congress to do, was to take bets on these areas where we need to make sure that we’re maintaining our lead."</p>

The new 53-person bureau, Pascual notes, will "strengthen our capacity to coordinate our energy diplomacy issues in order to have a greater impact on protecting our national security and our national economic interests" and will be "organized around three central principles. The first of these is managing the geopolitics of today’s energy economy. . . . The second pillar is focused on stimulating the market forces that drive the demand for renewable clean energy and energy efficiency technologies, and the financial vehicles that can stimulate their adoption. . . . the third pillar is focused on energy access and transparency." Pascual says that "In developing the bureau, we’ve worked very closely with our inter-agency partners, and . . . especially with the Department of Energy. We’ve had a very close relationship with them. The Department of Energy has unparalleled expertise on technological issues. Secretary Chu has been a tremendous leader in this area. We can complement that with diplomatic capabilities on the policy side, and on market dialogues, where at times the Department of Energy doesn’t have the personnel deployed around the world to sustain that on the same kind of ongoing basis. And so between the two of us working together, we think we can achieve much greater complementarities and much greater effect between their technological capabilities and our capabilities on the diplomatic and policy side."</p>

"The final decisions on Solyndra were mine," the Secretary tells the committee, "and I made them with the best interest of the taxpayer in mind. I want to be clear: over the course of Solyndra’s loan guarantee, I did not make any decision based on political considerations. My decision to guarantee a loan to Solyndra was based on the analysis of experienced professionals and on the strength of the information they had available to them at the time. The Solyndra transaction went through more than two years of rigorous technical, financial and legal due diligence, spanning two Administrations, before a loan guarantee was issued. Based on thorough internal and external analysis of both the market and the technology, and extensive review of information provided by Solyndra and others, the Department concluded that Solyndra was poised to compete in the marketplace and had a good prospect of repaying the government’s loan." The Secretary testifies before the committee for over five hours. Following the hearing, a White House spokesperson says that "Secretary Chu has the president’s full confidence."</p>

A six-level structure built in 1953, CPP-601 was used for the dissolution, separation, and chemical retrieval of uranium-235 from spent nuclear fuel – essentially a recycling process.</p>
<p><strong>December 23, 2011</strong><br />President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/23/statement-president-hr-2055">signs into law</a> the "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, funding the federal government through FY 2012. Overall spending levels were agreed upon in the July 31 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/31/fact-sheet-bipartisan-debt-deal-win-economy-and-budget-discipline">bipartisan deal</a> to raise the debt limit and reduce the deficit. Most energy-policy riders are dropped, but an included rider blocks enforcement by DOE of new energy efficiency rules for light bulbs through the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong>December 27, 2011</strong><br />The Environmental Protection Agency <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/1e5ab1124055f3b28525781f0042ed40/a7ce72844710be0a85257973006a20f3!OpenDocument">finalizes</a> the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/documents/420f11044.pdf">2012 percentage standards</a> for four fuel categories that are part of the agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS2). The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established the RFS2 program and the annual renewable fuel volume targets, which steadily increase to an overall level of 36 billion gallons in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>December 29, 2011</strong><br />The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/newsroom/2011/december/NR_12_29_2011A.html">publishes</a> in the <em>Federal Register</em> an <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-12-29/pdf/2011-33429.pdf">Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> to give the public background information about the BLM’s interest in establishing an efficient, competitive process for issuing right-of-way leases for solar and wind energy development on the public lands. Such a process, according to the BLM, would help ensure fair access to leasing opportunities for renewable energy development and capture fair market value for the use of public lands. Existing regulations limit the competitive process to procedures for responding to overlapping right-of-way applications. The BLM is seeking input on how best to offer public lands through a nomination and competitive process instead of just by right-of-way application.</p>
