<p><strong>January 5, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../articles/department-energy-launches-initiative-industry-better-protect-nation-s-electric-grid-cyber.html">announces</a> an initiative to further protect the electrical grid from cyber attacks: the “Electric Sector Cybersecurity Risk Management Maturity” project, a White House initiative led by the Department in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The initiative will develop a “maturity model” that allows utility companies and grid operators to measure their current capabilities and analyze gaps in their cyber defenses. Maturity models, which rely on best practices to identify an organization’s strengths and weaknesses, are widely used by other sectors to improve performance, efficiency, and quality. Deputy Secretary Daniel Poneman and other officials from the Department, the White House, and DHS meet with more than two dozen senior leaders from across the electric sector. Over the next several months, the Department will host a series of workshops with the private sector to draft a maturity model that can be used throughout the electric sector. Howard Schmidt, White House cybersecurity coordinator, posts an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/01/09/protecting-nation-s-electric-grid-cyber-threats">article</a> on the White House blog on January 9.</p>

<p><strong>January 11, 2012</strong><br />The Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2012/01/11/what%e2%80%99s-in-the-universe/">announces</a> that researchers have used visual information from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys to make the most accurate calculation yet of how matter in the universe clumps together – from a time when the universe was only half its present age until now. “The way galaxies cluster together over vast expanses of the sky tells us how both ordinary visible matter and underlying invisible dark matter are distributed, across space and back in time,” says Shirley Ho, an astrophysicist at the laboratory who led the work. “The distribution gives us cosmic rulers to measure how the universe has expanded, and a basis for calculating what’s in it: how much dark matter, how much dark energy, even the mass of the hard-to-see neutrinos it contains. What’s left over is the ordinary matter and energy we’re familiar with.”</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2012/01/11/critical-materials/">announces</a> that it will be reviving the study of critical rare earths to better understand how to extract them, use them more efficiently, reuse and recycle them, and find substitutes for them. Rare earths are used in almost every high-tech gadget and clean energy technology invented in the last 30 years, from smart phones to wind turbines to hybrid cars. The vast majority are now mined in China and the supply has been subject to fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2012</strong><br />The parties to Hanford's Tri-Party Agreement (TPA)--DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Washington State Department of Ecology--<a href="http://www.hanford.gov/c.cfm/media/attachments.cfm/DOE/DandHWasteSitesMilestones.pdf">announce</a> that 77 waste sites have been cleaned up meeting two TPA milestones. Workers removed 1.2 million tons of soil and debris containing heavy metals, hydrocarbons, gas, diesel, oil-based liquids, and radioactive constituents in the D and H Reactor Areas at Hanford along the Columbia River. The soil and debris were transported to Hanford’s landfill, the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility.</p>

Agreements by the three provide funding to environmental review and permitting, ensuring continued consideration of the project.</p>
<p><strong>January 12, 2012</strong><br />The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Faceee.org%252Fpress%252F2012%252F01%252Faceee-report-us-better-thinking-big-.html" rel="nofollow">issues</a> a report, <a href="///\\Doe\research-report\e121"><em>The Long-Term Energy Efficiency Potential: What the Evidence Suggests</em></a>, that finds that more attention needs to be paid to large-scale energy efficiency savings that could cut U.S. energy consumption over 50 percent and save consumers more than $300 to $400 billion per year. The reports also states that the nation is making the mistake of “crowding out” economically beneficial investments in energy efficiency by focusing on riskier and more expensive bids to develop new energy sources.</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu in a <a href="http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1217/ML12171A674.pdf">letter</a> to supporters of the American Centrifuge Project (ACP) informs them that the Department will assume $44 million in liability for uranium tails that USEC is contractually required to dispose of. This frees the company to invest the $44 million in further ACP research work. The Secretary notes that this is only a "down payment" that gives Congress the "time it needs to act" in authorizing DOE to provide an additional $106 million needed by USEC for ACP research and development.</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Office of Health, Safety and Security releases a <a href="../ea/downloads/independent-oversight-assessment-waste-treatment-and-immobilization-plant-january-2012.html">report</a> providing an Independent Oversight Assessment of nuclear safety culture and nuclear safety concerns at the Hanford Site Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). HSS determines that "most personnel at WTP believed that safety was a high priority. However, during the safety culture evaluation, a significant number of staff . . . expressed reluctance to raise safety or quality concerns for various reasons. Fear of retaliation was identified in some . . . groups as inhibiting the identification of problems. Employees’ willingness to raise safety concerns without fear of retaliation is an essential element of a healthy safety culture, and therefore significant management attention is needed to improve the safety culture at WTP."</p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Office of Health, Safety and Security <a href="../ea/downloads/consent-order-battelle-energy-alliance-nco-2012-01.html">issues</a> a Consent Order to Battelle Energy Alliance at the Idaho National Laboratory related to issues associated with the inadvertent draining of cooling water from the reactor vessel at the Advanced Test Reactor that occurred during a maintenance outage on June 1, 2011. The draindown of approximately half the reactor vessel coolant above the fuel went unrecognized by the control room for two hours. This did not result in any "adverse effects," but the Department "considers this event to be of high nuclear safety significance." Battelle agrees to take corrective actions and pay $250,000.</p>
<p><strong>January 16, 2012</strong><br />Deputy Secretary Poneman and South African Minister of Energy Dipuo Peters hold the <a href="../articles/deputy-secretary-poneman-statement-second-meeting-us-south-africa-bilateral-energy-dialogue.html">second meeting</a> of the U.S. – South Africa Bilateral Energy Dialogue.

The second is a strategy of "Build on Our Strengths in Manufacturing and Energy," which focuses on "the manufacturing sector and how we can scale up and support clean energy while responsibly accessing unconventional supplies."</p>
<p><strong>January 17, 2012</strong><br />The Department <a href="../fe/articles/utility-purchase-electricity-innovative-doe-supported-clean.html">announces</a> the first U.S. purchase by a utility of low-carbon power from a commercial-scale, coal-based power plant with carbon capture. CPS Energy of San Antonio, the nation's largest municipally owned utility, will purchase approximately 200 megawatts (MW) of power from the Texas Clean Energy Project (TCEP), located just west of Midland-Odessa. The 400-MW TCEP plant is a first-of-its-kind Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle poly-generation facility believed to be the cleanest coal-fueled power plant operating anywhere in the world. The facility is capable of capturing 90 percent of the carbon dioxide it produces, as well as 99 percent of sulfur dioxide, 90 percent of nitrogen oxide, and 99 percent of mercury. The $2.4 billion plant will receive $450 million in funding from the Department’s Clean Coal Power Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu discusses clean energy in <a href="../articles/secretary-chus-remarks-city-club-cleveland-prepared-delivery.html">remarks</a> at the City Club of Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2012</strong><br />The Department <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/progress_alerts.cfm/pa_id=664">releases</a> two nationwide resource assessments showing that waves and tidal currents off the nation's coasts could contribute significantly to the U.S.' total annual electricity production. These assessments, combined with ongoing analyses of the technologies and other resource assessments, show that water power, including conventional hydropower and wave, tidal, and other water power resources, can potentially provide 15% of the nation's electricity by 2030. The two reports—<a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/water/pdfs/mappingandassessment.pdf"><em>Mapping and Assessment of the United States Ocean Wave Energy Resource</em> </a>and <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/water/pdfs/1023527.pdf"><em>Assessment of Energy Production Potential from Tidal Streams in the United States</em></a>—calculate the maximum kinetic energy available from waves and tides off U.S. coasts that could be used for future energy production.</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Office of Inspector General issues a <a href="../ig/downloads/special-report-oas-ra-12-03.html">Special Report</a> on lessons learned/best practices during DOE's implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. As part of the Recovery Act, DOE received more than $35 billion to support a number of science, energy, and environmental initiatives, and its authority to make or guarantee energy-related loans increased to as much as $52 billion. "As might be expected in such a complex undertaking," the report notes, "certain actions did not initially achieve<br />their intended result. There were notable successes and some failures."</p>
<p><strong>January 18, 2012</strong><br />The Department of State (DOS) <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/01/181473.htm">recommends</a> to President Obama that the presidential permit for the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline be denied and, that at this time, the TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline be determined not to serve the national interest. President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/18/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline">concurs</a> with DOS’s recommendation, which was predicated on the fact that DOS does not have sufficient time to obtain the information necessary to assess whether the project, in its current state, is in the national interest. On December 23, 2011, Congress passed the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, which provides 60 days for the President to determine whether the Keystone XL pipeline is in the national interest. DOS’s denial of the permit application does not preclude any subsequent permit application or applications for similar projects.</p>

<p><strong>January 20, 2012</strong><br />The Department, in a draft Funding Opportunity Announcement, <a href="../articles/energy-department-takes-first-step-spur-us-manufacturing-small-modular-nuclear-reactors.html">takes the first step</a> toward manufacturing small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. The Department will establish cost-shared agreements with private industry to support the design and licensing of SMRs. Small modular reactors, approximately one-third the size of current nuclear plants, have compact designs that are expected to offer a host of safety, siting, construction, and economic benefits. Specifically, they could be made in factories and transported to sites where they would be ready to “plug and play” upon arrival, reducing both capital costs and construction times. The small size also makes SMRs ideal for small electric grids and for locations that cannot support large reactors, providing utilities with the flexibility to scale production as demand changes.</p>

"Our updated Reference case projections show natural gas and renewables gaining an increasing share of U.S. electric power generation, domestic crude oil and natural gas production growing, reliance on imported oil decreasing, U.S. natural gas production exceeding consumption, and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions remaining below their 2005 level through 2035," says EIA Acting Administrator Howard Gruenspecht in his rollout <a href="http://www.eia.gov/pressroom/presentations/howard_01232012.pdf">presentation</a>. A major difference in the 2012 versus the 2011 report is that "the estimated unproved technically recoverable resource (TRR) of shale gas for the United States is 482 trillion cubic feet, substantially below the estimate of 827 trillion cubic feet in AEO2011. The decline largely reflects a decrease in the estimate for the Marcellus shale, from 410 trillion cubic feet to 141 trillion cubic feet. Both EIA and USGS have recently made significant revisions to their TRR estimates for the Marcellus shale. Drilling in the Marcellus accelerated rapidly in 2010 and 2011, so that there is far more information available today than a year ago."</p>

"Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy," states the President. "Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. . . . But with only 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy. A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs." Asserting that the "the development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy, " the President notes that "it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock – reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground." He adds that "what’s true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy. . . . Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. . . . Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don’t always come right away. Some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy."

<p><strong>March 1, 2012</strong><br />President Obama, in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/01/remarks-president-american-energy">remarks</a> at Nashua Community College in Nashua, New Hampshire, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/03/01/president-obama-gas-prices-and-oil-subsidies">discusses</a> gas prices and ending oil industry subsidies. "The amount of oil that we drill at home doesn’t set the price of gas on its own," the President says. "And the reason is, is because oil is bought and sold on the world energy market. And just like last year, the biggest thing that’s causing the price of oil to rise right now is instability in the Middle East. This time it's Iran. . . . So when you start hearing a bunch of folks saying somehow that there's some simple solution, you can turn a nozzle and suddenly we're going to be getting a lot more oil, that’s not just how it works. Over the long term, the biggest reason oil prices will rise is because of growing demand in countries like China and India and Brazil."</p>
<p><strong>March 1, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/HHRG-112-SY-WState-SChu-20120301.pdf">testifies</a> before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology <a href="http://science.house.gov/hearing/full-committee-hearing-overview-department-energy-rd-budget-fy-2013">hearing</a> on DOE's Research and Development Budget for Fiscal Year 2013. Chairman Ralph Hall (R-TX) focuses on "misplaced priorities . . . and the budget’s call to 'double-down' on clean energy spending." Vice Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) tells the Secretary that the "price of gas has gone up 100% on your watch, and this is unacceptable. All American consumers are being punished." The Secretary responds that "We are very concerned that as gasoline prices and oil prices increase, that can have a dampening effect on the economy. That is why we are so focused on this, and that is why the tools that I have in the Department of Energy are focused on what we can do both in the near-term future, but in the mid and long-term future." Secretary Chu also says that Strategic Petroleum Reserve could be tapped if it is determined that such a step is warranted. "All options are on the table," he says. "The President will use whatever tools he has to what we have to do."</p>
<p><strong>March 1, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../articles/energy-department-announces-180-million-ambitious-new-initiative-deploy-us-offshore-wind.html">announces</a> a planned six-year $180 million initiative to capture the potential of wind energy off American coasts.

In these situations, which usually happen in the springtime when there is a lot of water in the Columbia River system, some generators must be turned off. As the transmission grid operator, BPA is required to develop a method for determining which generators must be turned off first. BPA’s plan allows for displacing generators after all other reasonable actions are taken. While BPA operates the transmission grid, it also is responsible for generation units. In times of high water, federal system operators must run the federal hydroelectric plants in order to comply with environmental regulations to protect fish.</p>

<p><strong>March 12, 2012</strong><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) releases a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-157">report</a> on DOE's Loan Guarantee Program and finds that further actions are needed by DOE to improve the tracking and review of loan applications.</p>
<p><strong>March 13, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=7a41542a-9bb2-41da-af14-05a425f7d3ad">testifies</a> before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources <a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-and-business-meetings?ID=d0867c7a-9cca-4f12-8bb9-57d0fa02ab58">hearing</a> (<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg76906/html/CHRG-112shrg76906.htm">transcript</a>) on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/report_on_doe_loan_and_guarantee_portfolio.pdf">Independent Review</a> of the current state of DOE’s clean energy loan portfolio <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/10/independent-report-review-confirms-energy-loan-portfolio-expected-perform-well">released</a> by the White House on February 10. Herbert Allison, author of the report, also <a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=6d656f18-fdf7-4fdc-9699-b055a693fb16">testifies</a>. The Secretary states that DOE is working to upgrade the loan program. "We have improved, and will continue to improve, processes for proactive monitoring, loan administration, compliance, reporting, and resolution capabilities to take into account industry best practices," he says. "And we have upgraded the electronic systems of the Loan Programs Office to better automate and standardize data, so it can be reviewed and acted upon in a timely and streamlined manner, and best inform decisions. In addition, we have put in place rigorous internal and external reviews to hold the Loan Programs Office accountable. The Department takes our responsibility to U.S. taxpayers seriously, and we are looking closely at Mr. Allison's recommendations for additional improvements."</p>
<p><strong>March 13, 2012</strong><br />The Department holds a closed-door meeting at the White House with executives from more than 30 major companies focusing on the tax-related benefits of partnering with renewable-energy developers. "We certainly hope Congress enacts the president’s budget, but in the meantime, we have to deal with what we’ve got," says Richard Kauffman, a senior adviser to Secretary Chu. "So the intent of this meeting is to get people in a room to share information about tax-equity investment in renewable energy."</p>
<p><strong>March 13, 2012</strong><br />President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/13/remarks-president-fair-trade">announces</a> that the U.S., Japan, and the European Union are filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization against China for its export restraints on its near-monopoly rare earth metals that are used by American manufacturers to make a wide variety of products, including hybrid car batteries, wind turbines, energy-efficient lighting, steel, advanced electronics, automobiles, petroleum, and chemicals. "America’s workers and manufacturers are being hurt in both established and budding industrial sectors by these policies," <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2012/march/united-states-challenges-china’s-export-restraints-r">says</a> U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. "China continues to make its export restraints more restrictive, resulting in massive distortions and harmful disruptions in supply chains for these materials throughout the global marketplace."</p>

Subcommittee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (CA-D) focuses on DOE's spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste program. "If there is anything that you need in this budget to do it quicker, faster, and make the decisions quicker and faster, I want to advocate for it,” she tells the Secretary. "I feel passionately about this. I want to find a way to get you what you need." Secretary Chu responds that "We share your sense of urgency. Within our jurisdiction now, we are not sitting idly by. The things that we hope Congress will allow us to act on, we are moving forward on these things. . . . The details need to be spelled out."</p>

<p><strong>March 15, 2012</strong><br />The National Ignition Facility (NIF), the world's most energetic laser, at DOE's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2012/Mar/NR-12-03-02.html">surpasses</a> a critical milestone in its efforts to meet one of modern science's greatest challenges: achieving fusion ignition and energy gain in a laboratory setting. NIF's 192 lasers fired in perfect unison, delivering a record 1.875 million joules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to the facility's target chamber center. The historic laser shot involves a shaped pulse of energy 23 billionths of a second long that generated 411 trillion watts (TW) of peak power (1,000 times more than the U.S. uses at any instant in time).</p>
<p><strong>March 15, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Office of Inspector General issues an <a href="../ig/downloads/audit-report-oas-l-12-03.html">Audit Report</a> to determine whether the Office of Management (EM) was effectively managing and planning for declining budget allocations. The report finds that "although EM's current annual budget planning process appeared to be adequate to address the nearly five percent decline in budget allocations that we tested, more extensive reductions could put future regulatory and agreement milestones at risk. Given the current widespread calls for dramatic reductions in Federal spending, it is possible that the process currently in place that is based on site needs and requirements may lead to an increase in missed regulatory and agreement milestones as budget allocations are further reduced across the complex."</p>
<p><strong>March 16, 2012</strong><br />Secretary Chu <a href="../articles/power-marketing-administrations-poised-make-another-big-contribution-america-s-progress.html">sends</a> a <a href="../downloads/memorandum-secretary-chu-power-marketing-administrations-role-march-16-2012.html">memo</a> to the Administrators of DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) outlining a strategy to ensure that the PMAs can play a leadership role in their respective regions in modernizing the grid to meet 21st century needs. The strategy includes upgrading and replacing aging electricity infrastructure and utilizing new tools and technology that would better utilize existing infrastructure; leveraging all available resources and tools--including private-public partnerships, increased collaboration with grid owners and operators, and loan financing for critical, job-creating transmission projects--to build a stronger, more resilient electric grid; and developing new rate structures that save consumers money by promoting energy efficiency and demand response programs that will reduce costs by better managing the electricity load at times when demand for electricity is highest. The rate structures also will help ensure that new clean energy resources from wind and solar power are efficiently and effectively integrated into the grid. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (WA-R) issues a <a href="http://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=285146">statement</a> noting that "While some of the Secretary’s goals may be laudable, the statutory basis of some of these proposed actions is at best unclear and the impact on consumers potentially significant. The Secretary should remember that the traditional mission of the PMAs is to provide the lowest-cost energy possible to their customers within sound business principles."</p>

<p><strong>March 20, 2012</strong><br />Administrators from DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMA) testify before the House Committee on Natural Resources' Subcommittee on Water and Power <a href="http://naturalresources.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=281112">hearing</a> on proposed spending, priorities, and missions for FY 2013. Full committee Chairman Doc Hastings (WA-R) <a href="http://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hastingsopeningstatement03.20.12.pdf">states</a> that Secretary Chu's PMA initiative <a href="../articles/power-marketing-administrations-poised-make-another-big-contribution-america-s-progress.html">announced</a> March 16 "could dramatically alter the way these agencies do business. Mandating PMAs to change their rate structure to integrate even more wind and to provide power for electric vehicles will only increase energy rates, further strain the transmission system, and shift costs to consumers for little or no benefit." Stephen Wright of the Bonneville Power Administration says that the Secretary's initiative is consistent with steps the PMA's are already taking. "At this point," he states, "I don’t agree that rates will go up because it is already embedded in our current restructuring activities." Timothy Meeks of the <a href="http://ww2.wapa.gov/sites/western/newsroom/NewsReleases/Documents/2012/032012_testimony.htm">Western Area Power Administration</a> adds that "This is a beginning of a dialogue for us and the customers out there, the utility industry, and so, again, consistent with my colleague here, we have been implementing things in the direction of improving the electric utility grid."</p>
<p><strong>March 20, 2012</strong><br />Adam Sieminski, the Administration's nominee for administrator of DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA), <a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=277c8bad-3974-4b6b-a6d9-a921dd27817b">testifies</a> before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources <a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-and-business-meetings?ID=c509d17e-4a9d-425d-a214-7024b0cad7de">hearing</a> on nominations.

Some information, for example, is still being collected by fax when "web based systems would be far more accurate and ultimately cheaper." He adds that data in EIA's forecasts needs to be "more readily available to . . . stakeholders including the Congress, the public and others. There are some wonderful innovations actually in the last year or so at EIA. The daily energy briefs, the weekly energy updates that are shorter, punchier, more market relevant . . . . I’d like to see EIA carry on with that."</p>
<p><strong>March 20, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Sandia National Laboratories <a href="https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/z-fusion-energy-output/">announces</a> that, according to a series of computer simulations performed, high-gain nuclear fusion could be achieved in a preheated cylindrical container immersed in strong magnetic fields. The simulations show the release of output energy many times greater than the energy fed into the container’s liner. The method appears to be 50 times more efficient than using X-rays — a previous favorite at Sandia — to drive implosions of targeted materials to create fusion conditions. Such fusion eventually could produce reliable electricity from seawater.</p>

"Here in Seoul," the President says, "more than 50 nations will mark our progress toward the goal we set at the summit I hosted two years ago in Washington -- securing the world’s vulnerable nuclear materials in four years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists. And since then, nations -- including the United States -- have boosted security at nuclear facilities. . . . And that's why here in Seoul, we need to keep at it. . . . We’re now expecting more commitments -- tangible, concrete action -- to secure nuclear materials and, in some cases, remove them completely. This is the serious, sustained global effort that we need, and it's an example of more nations bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges. This is how the international community should work in the 21st century."</p>

<p><strong>May 11, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Office of Legacy Management <a href="../lm/articles/news-release-doe-announces-riverton-water-sampling-results.html">announces</a> that residential drinking water testing from an alternative water supply system in Riverton, Wyoming, confirmed the water is safe. Results from water samples collected on May 3 show that uranium levels at 0.0001 milligrams per liter, well below the drinking water standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency. On May 2, DOE officials learned that water samples from four residences, conducted by the Northern Arapaho Utility Organization in October 2011, had tested positive for high concentrations of uranium. DOE responded immediately by delivering bottled water to the affected residents and maintaining their bottled water supply until additional samples could be collected, analyzed, and verified as safe. The DOE Riverton Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act Title I site, located on the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming, processed uranium ore from 1958 to 1963. While there are no tailings disposal cells at Riverton, historical ore processing resulted in contamination of the shallow groundwater.</p>

<p><strong>July 5, 2012</strong><br />The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at DOE's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory produces a historic <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2012/Jul/NR-12-07-01.html">record-breaking laser shot</a>. The NIF laser system of 192 beams delivers more than 500 trillion watts (terawatts or TW) of peak power and 1.85 megajoules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to its target. Five hundred terawatts is 1,000 times more power than the U.S. uses at any instant in time, and 1.85 megajoules of energy is about 100 times what any other laser regularly produces today. The shot validates NIF's most challenging laser performance specifications set in the late 1990s when scientists were planning the world's most energetic laser facility. Combining extreme levels of energy and peak power on a target in the NIF is a critical requirement for achieving one of physics' grand challenges--igniting hydrogen fusion fuel in the laboratory and producing more energy than that supplied to the target.</p>

The problem is, is that we haven’t established clear guidelines for how to do it safely, and informed the public so that neighbors know what’s going on, and your family, you can make sure that any industry that’s operating in your area, that they’re being responsible. So what we’ve said is, look, we are going to work with industry to establish best practices. We are going to invest in the basic research and science required to make sure this is done safely and in a way that protects the public health. And for responsible companies, they should be able to operate, make a profit, and we can all benefit and put people back to work.  But if you’re an irresponsible company that’s not doing the right thing, we’re going to hold you to account.  And that’s how we should develop this incredible resource -- which, by the way, if we do it properly, could end up changing the economics and politics globally of energy in a way that's actually very good for us, because we'll be less dependent on what happens in the Middle East and our economy will be less subject to the kinds of spikes that we saw earlier in the spring in terms of gas prices."</p>

We have doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day -- more than any administration in recent history. And today, the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades." He states that the American people have a choice "between a strategy that reverses this progress, or one that builds on it. We’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we’ll open more. But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country’s energy plan, or endanger our coastlines, or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers. We’re offering a better path. We’re offering a better path, where we -- a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal; where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks; where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy; where we develop a hundred-year supply of natural gas that’s right beneath our feet.  If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone. And, yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet -- because climate change is not a hoax."</p>

The program will run on the lab's Mira supercomputer, the third-fastest computer in the world, and will use trillions of "particles"-- elements in the simulation that stand in for small bits of matter. The computer will let time run, and watch as the particles move through space in response to the forces acting on them. As the simulation progresses over a two week period, these bits of matter will clump together under gravity to form larger and larger blobs representing galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters. The laboratory also <a href="http://www.anl.gov/articles/no-magic-show-real-world-levitation-inspire-better-pharmaceuticals">announces</a> that scientists are using levitation to improve the drug development process, eventually yielding more effective pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects.

<p><strong>September 17, 2012</strong><br />The Department's Sandia National Laboratories <a href="https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/nuclear_fusion/">announces</a> that magnetically imploded tubes called liners, intended to help produce controlled nuclear fusion at scientific “break-even” energies or better within the next few years, have functioned successfully in preliminary tests. To exceed scientific break-even is the most hotly sought-after goal of fusion research, in which the energy released by a fusion reaction is greater than the energy put into it — an achievement that would have extraordinary energy and defense implications. That the liners survived their electromagnetic drubbing is a key step in stimulating further Sandia testing of a concept called MagLIF (Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion), which will use magnetic fields and laser pre-heating in the quest for energetic fusion.</p>

Both candidates in their opening two minute presentation on domestic issues refer to the significance of energy. The President says that it is important "to develop new sources of energy here in America." Governor Romney cites a five point plan to get the nation moving again, the first of which is "get us energy independent -- North America energy independent.  That creates about 4 million jobs." In a follow-up, the President says he and Governor Romney "both agree that we've got to boost American energy production. And oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments." Governor Romney says "Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up -- but not due to his policies, in spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I’m President, I’ll double them and also get the oil from offshore in Alaska, and I’ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And by the way, I like coal. I’m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it’s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs."</p>

The President responds that in his first term "we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere. But we haven't done as much as we need to. So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can -- what more can we do to make a short-term progress in reducing carbons, and then working through an education process that I think is necessary -- a discussion, a conversation across the country about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with."</p>
