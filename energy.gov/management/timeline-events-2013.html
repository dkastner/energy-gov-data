<p>The Department <a href="../downloads/strategy-management-and-disposal-used-nuclear-fuel-and-high-level-radioactive-waste.html">issues</a> the <em>Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste</em>, a framework for moving toward a sustainable program to deploy an integrated system capable of transporting, storing, and disposing of used nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from civilian nuclear power generation, defense, national security, and other activities. The Strategy serves as a statement of Administration policy regarding the importance of addressing the disposition of used nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, lays out the overall design of a system to address that issue, and outlines the reforms needed to implement such a system. It also presents the Administration’s response to the <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fcybercemetery.unt.edu%252Farchive%252Fbrc%252F20120620220235%252Fhttp%253A%252Fbrc.gov%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252Fdocuments%252Fbrc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf.html" rel="nofollow">final report</a> and recommendations made by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future. The Strategy includes a phased, adaptive, and consent-based approach to siting and implementing a comprehensive management and disposal system. At its core, this Strategy endorses a waste management system containing a pilot interim storage facility, a larger, full-scale interim storage facility, and a geologic repository in a timeframe that demonstrates the federal commitment to addressing the nuclear waste issue.</p>
<p><strong>January 11, 2013</strong></p>
<p>The Department's Office of Inspector General (IG) <a href="../ig/downloads/audit-report-oas-l-13-04.html">issues</a> an <a href="../sites/prod/files/OAS-L-13-04.pdf">Audit Report</a> to determine whether DOE has effectively managed the disposition of surplus nuclear materials. The IG finds that DOE has “strengthened its nuclear materials management program by developing a life cycle nuclear materials management policy, implementing strategic plans for consolidation and disposition of nuclear materials and refining its nuclear materials management organization.” Management challenges nonetheless remain, including DOE not having “designated certain nuclear materials as National Assets to enable retention and continued availability.”</p>

The public-private partnership has made steady progress in creating viable alternatives to gas-powered vehicles, according to the report, but formidable technical barriers have prevented the emergence of a stand-out contender to replace petroleum. U.S. DRIVE is a government-industry partnership conducting precompetitive research and development to help accelerate the emergence of advanced technologies for clean and efficient light-duty vehicles that could eventually compete commercially with petroleum vehicles. The partnership participants include four automotive companies, five energy companies, two electric power companies, and the Electric Power Research Institute, with DOE providing federal leadership. The partnership has determined three potential primary pathways to reaching significantly reduced petroleum consumption: improved internal combustion engine vehicles coupled with greater use of biofuels and natural gas in conventional or hybrid vehicles; expanded use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles; and the possible transition to hydrogen as a transportation fuel.</p>

<p>The Department <a href="../articles/carbon-capture-and-storage-futuregen-20-project-moves-forward-second-phase.html">announces</a> the beginning of Phase II of project development with a new cooperative agreement with the FutureGen Industrial Alliance for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Illinois. The completion of the FutureGen 2.0 project’s first phase included important technical and financial milestones like the identification of a sequestration site in Morgan County, Illinois, preliminary characterization and test drilling, and a commitment from the Illinois Commerce Commission to cover the FutureGen 2.0 project’s output under its power purchasing plans. Phase II will build on these successes to begin preliminary design, pre-construction and engineering for the retrofitted, near-zero emission coal-fired power plant. In cooperation with the FutureGen project partners, the Department is investing in the upgrade of a coal-fired power plant with oxy-combustion technology to capture more than 1 million tons of CO2 each year—more than 90 percent of the plant’s carbon emissions. Other emissions will also be reduced to near-zero levels. Instead of capturing CO2 in the presence of a large amount of nitrogen, the oxy-combustion approach extracts the oxygen from air before combustion, greatly reducing the cost of carbon capture at the exhaust stack.</p>

<p>President Obama delivers the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/president-barack-obamas-state-union-address-prepared-delivery">State of the Union Address</a>, with <a href="../articles/president-obama-talks-energy-state-union-2013.html">extended remarks</a> on energy issues. The President states the “first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing,” and to accomplish this the nation needs “a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.” He notes that “no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar . . . . We produce more natural gas than ever before . . . . But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend.  But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense. . . . The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change . . . . But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to . . . speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy. . . . Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. We’ve begun to change that. . . . [M]uch of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together.  So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.”</p>

<p>The Department <a href="../articles/energy-department-announces-new-funding-opportunity-innovative-small-modular-reactors.html">announces</a> a new funding opportunity to help U.S. industry design and certify innovative small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Small modular reactors – which are approximately one-third the size of current nuclear power plants – have compact, scalable designs that are expected to offer a host of safety, construction and economic benefits. DOE is seeking 300 megawatts or smaller reactor designs that can be made in factories and transported to sites where they would be ready to “plug and play” upon arrival. The smaller size reduces both capital costs and construction times and also makes these reactors ideal for small electric grids and for locations that cannot support large reactors. DOE will solicit proposals for cost-shared small modular reactor projects that have the potential to be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and achieve commercial operation around 2025, while offering innovative and effective solutions for enhanced safety, operations and performance. Selected projects will span a five-year period with at least 50 percent provided by private industry. Federal funding for this solicitation and the project <a href="../articles/energy-department-announces-new-investment-us-small-modular-reactor-design-and.html">announced last year</a> will be derived from the total $452 million identified for the Department’s Small Modular Reactor Licensing Technical Support program.</p>

And few pieces of business are more important for us than getting our energy future right. So here at Argonne, and other labs around the country, scientists are working on getting us where we need to get 10 years from now, 20 years from now. Today, what most Americans feel first when it comes to energy prices -- or energy issues are prices that they pay at the pump. And over the past few weeks, we saw -- we went through another spike in gas prices. . . . So we’re making progress, but the only way to really break this cycle of spiking gas prices, the only way to break that cycle for good is to shift our cars entirely -- our cars and trucks -- off oil. That’s why . . . I called on Congress to set up an Energy Security Trust to fund research into new technologies that will help us reach that goal.” Under the President's proposal, the U.S. would set aside $2 billion over 10 years to support research into a range of cost-effective technologies, such as advanced vehicles that run on electricity, homegrown biofuels, fuel cells, and domestically produced natural gas.

The EIA notes that the “growing supply of domestic light crude oil in the Midcontinent has already prompted both midstream and downstream changes. Pipelines like Seaway that were once used to carry imported oil up from Gulf Coast ports to reach Midwest refiners have been reversed and are moving inland crude oil down to the Gulf, and their capacity is being dramatically expanded. New pipeline infrastructure is also under construction, including the southern portion of the Keystone XL project, which is slated to be in operation by year‐end, and more has been proposed. There have also been major developments in rail transport, where shipments of crude increased dramatically in 2012 compared to 2011. Significant changes in the refining industry are expected over the next few years to accommodate this fast‐growing domestic supply of light‐sweet crude oil.”</p>

<p>The Department announces that two DOE employees have been selected as finalists for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal from the Partnership for Public Service. Dr. Paul D. Jablonski, Metallurgist at DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, <a href="../articles/energy-department-metallurgist-recognized-development-revolutionary-coronary-stent.html">is selected</a> for his revolutionary development of coronary stent technology. Jablonski developed a stent made of a platinum-chromium alloy, making it visible to an x-ray, and also enhancing the stent’s safety and reliability. Stents were previously made only of bare metal, and some are coated with medication to prevent narrowing of the arteries. This technology is no longer necessary because of Jablonski’s development. Dr. Josh Silverman, Director of DOE’s Office of Sustainability Support, <a href="../articles/energy-department-employee-recognized-eliminating-one-million-tons-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html">is selected</a> for his dedication to reducing DOE’s greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44223">issues a report</a> on the effects of a carbon tax on the economy and the environment. The effects on the economy would depend on how the revenues from the tax were used. Options include using the revenues to reduce budget deficits, to decrease existing marginal tax rates, or to offset the costs that a carbon tax would impose on certain groups of people. Because significantly limiting the extent of future global warming would require a concerted effort by countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases, U.S. efforts to decrease emissions would produce only incremental benefits, in the form of incremental reductions in the expected damage from climate change.</p>

Using energy economic models based on the 2011 U.S. tax code, the report finds that the combined effect of energy-related tax subsidies on greenhouse gas emissions is minimal and could be negative or positive. Provisions subsidizing renewable electricity reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while those for ethanol and other biofuels may have slightly increased greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the report examines the broader implications of tax provisions and climate change policy and concludes that tax policies can make a substantial contribution to meeting the nation's climate change objectives, but the current approaches will not accomplish that.  While the report does not make any recommendations about specific changes to the tax code, it says that policies that target emissions directly, such as carbon taxes or tradable emissions allowances, would be the most effective and efficient ways of reducing greenhouse gases.</p>

The IG finds that NNSA restored many of the former Los Alamos capabilities at the NCERC in Nevada but notes that several problems with start-up activities resulted in delays in restoring the full array of experimental capabilities included in the project.</p>

<p>The Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/vela">commemorates</a> the 50th Anniversary of the launch of the first pair of Vela Hotel satellites from Cape Canaveral. The purpose of Vela was to monitor compliance with the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, a cornerstone arms control treaty which prohibits nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under water. The original Vela contract called for 10 satellites at the cost of $15 million. The first six satellites were so successful, reliable, and durable that the last four were never launched. In 1965, the Department of Defense approved an advanced Vela program equipped with more capable detectors, including optical flash detectors. Overall, twelve Vela satellites were launched—the last pair on April 8, 1970.</p>

<p>The Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in partnership with the Russian Federation, <a href="http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/rtg">has successfully completed the removal</a> of 14 Russian radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) from the Northern Sea Route. These devices, which contain high-activity radioactive sources, powered navigational beacons along Russia’s northern coastline. With this removal, DOE has completed its efforts to recover RTGs along the Northern Sea Route. RTGs were used for many years in Russia to generate electrical power at remote locations, including lighthouses and navigational beacons. The 14 RTGs DOE recently recovered contain more than one million curies of Strontium-90, a high-activity radioisotope that could be used in a dirty bomb.</p>

<p>The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a suit brought by the nuclear power industry seeking relief from the $750 million in annual fees collected by the Department for disposal of high-level nuclear waste, <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/2708C01ECFE3109F85257C280053406E/$file/11-1066-1466796.pdf">orders</a> DOE to “submit to Congress a proposal to change the fee to zero.” The issue, the court argues, “Is the government’s failure to conduct an adequate present fee assessment, as required by the statute. Our ruling here does not provide petitioners with any form of compensation, nor does it relieve them of their obligation to ultimately pay for the cost of their waste disposal. When the Secretary is again able to conduct a sufficient assessment, either because the Yucca Mountain project is revived, or because Congress enacts an alternative plan, then payments will resume.”</p>

Iran has committed to halting certain levels of enrichment and neutralizing part of its stockpiles. Iran cannot use its next-generation centrifuges, which are used for enriching uranium. Iran cannot install or start up new centrifuges, and its production of centrifuges will be limited. Iran will halt work at its plutonium reactor. And new inspections will provide extensive access to Iran’s nuclear facilities and allow the international community to verify whether Iran is keeping its commitments. These are substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. . . . Meanwhile, this first step will create time and space over the next six months for more negotiations to fully address our comprehensive concerns about the Iranian program.” The White House issues a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/23/fact-sheet-first-step-understandings-regarding-islamic-republic-iran-s-n">fact sheet</a>, and senior administration officials provide a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/24/background-briefing-senior-administration-officials-first-step-agreement">background briefing</a>.</p>

<p>Secretary Moniz <a href="../articles/energy-department-releases-grid-energy-storage-report.html">releases</a> DOE’s <a href="../oe/downloads/grid-energy-storage-december-2013.html">Grid Energy Storage report</a> to the members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The report was commissioned at the request of Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Committee Chairman. The report identifies the benefits of grid energy storage, the challenges that must be addressed to enable broader use, and the efforts of DOE, in conjunction with industry and other government organizations, to meet those challenges. The report identifies four challenges that must be addressed to enable energy storage: the development of cost-effective energy storage technologies, validated reliability and safety, an equitable regulatory environment, and industry acceptance. The need for energy storage in the electric grid is increasing as a result of the growing use of renewable power generation, which varies with wind and solar conditions, and increasing frequency of severe weather caused by climate change. The grid’s evolution toward more distributed energy systems and the incorporation of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids also contributes to the growing interest in grid storage.</p>

<p>The Department <a href="../nepa/articles/record-decision-issued-hanford-tank-closure-and-waste-management-eis.html">issues</a> the first in a series of <a href="../nepa/downloads/eis-0391-record-decision.html">Records of Decision</a> (RODs) pursuant to the <a href="../nepa/downloads/eis-0391-final-environmental-impact-statement.html">Final Tank Closure and Waste Management Environmental Impact Statement for the Hanford Site</a>. The ROD pertains to each of the three main areas analyzed in the EIS: tank closure, decommissioning of the Fast Flux Test Facility, and waste management. The decision includes retrieval of 99 percent of the waste currently stored in Hanford’s 177 underground storage tanks, landfill closure of the single-shell tank farm systems, and operation and maintenance of the tank farms. For the Fast Flux Test Facility, above-grade structures would be removed and below-grade structures would be entombed. To improve waste management at the site, existing facilities would be upgraded, low-level and mixed low-level radioactive waste from Hanford would be disposed of in an Integrated Disposal Facility, and an additional disposal facility for tank closure waste would be constructed, as needed. DOE will continue to defer the importation of offsite waste at Hanford, at least until the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant is operational.</p>

<p>The Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="http://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press402.cfm">releases</a> its <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/archive/aeo14/"><em>Annual Energy Outlook 2014</em></a> (<em>AEO2014</em>) Reference case, with updated projections for U.S. energy markets through 2040. “EIA's updated Reference case shows that advanced technologies for crude oil and natural gas production are continuing to increase domestic supply and reshape the U.S. energy economy as well as expand the potential for U.S. natural gas exports,” says EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski. “Growing domestic hydrocarbon production is also reducing our net dependence on imported oil and benefiting the U.S. economy as natural-gas-intensive industries boost their output.” The outlook projects that natural gas will overtake coal to provide the largest share of U.S. electric power generation. In 2040, natural gas accounts for 35% of total electricity generation, while coal accounts for 32%. Generation from renewable fuels, unlike coal and nuclear power, is higher in the 2014 outlook than the 2013.</p>
