The total FY 2013 LDRD program cost at the national laboratories was $568.6 million in 1,742 projects.</p>
<p><strong>January 2, 2014</strong></p>
<p>The Department's Office of Inspector General (IG) <a href="../ig/downloads/special-report-doeig-0901.html">issues</a> a <a href="../sites/prod/files/2014/01/f6/IG-0901_1.pdf">Special Report</a> on NNSA’s Management of the $245 million Nuclear Materials Safeguards and Security Upgrades Project Phase II at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The IG finds that the project suffered from a number of project management weaknesses. These issues ultimately resulted in cost increases of as much as $41 million and delayed completion of the project by nearly a year. In addition, management information systems failed to provide accurate and complete information about the funds available to complete the remaining work scope. These project management issues created a series of problems that collectively resulted in significant unanticipated cost and schedule impacts.</p>

<p>The Department’s Argonne National Laboratory <a href="http://www.anl.gov/articles/cobalt-catalysts-allow-researchers-duplicate-complicated-steps-photosynthesis">announces</a> that researchers have used cobalt catalysts to duplicate the complicated steps of photosynthesis. Currently, the most efficient methods for making fuel – principally, hydrogen – from sunlight and water involve rare and expensive metal catalysts, such as platinum. The Argonne researchers have found a new, more efficient way to link a less expensive synthetic cobalt-containing catalyst to an organic light-sensitive molecule, called a chromophore. Although cobalt is significantly less efficient than platinum when it comes to light-induced hydrogen generation, the drastic price difference between the two metals makes cobalt the obvious choice as the foundation for a synthetic catalyst.</p>

<p>President Obama delivers the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/28/president-barack-obamas-state-union-address">State of the Union Address</a>, with extended remarks on energy issues. “The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working,” the President says, “and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades. . . . One of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely, it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change. . . . It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too. Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced. Let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. And even as we’ve increased energy production, we’ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume. . . . Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet. Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.” The Department puts out a <a href="../articles/sotu-roundup-energy-highlights-2014-state-union.html">roundup</a> of the energy highlights in the address.</p>

The IG review reveals opportunities to improve the effectiveness of DOE's management of its technology transfer and commercialization efforts. Specifically, the IG finds that DOE had not finalized quantitative performance metrics necessary for it to determine the success of its technology transfer and commercialization efforts, developed a forward-looking approach for investing the Energy Technology Commercialization Fund required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and ensured the national laboratories were consistently treating their equity holdings in licensees received as part of their technology transfer efforts.  Due to turnover in key staff, the IG was unable to definitively determine why DOE had failed to finalize and transmit its Execution Plan to Congress. In the absence of finalized performance metrics and forward looking budgets, DOE is at increased risk of failing to maximize its return on investment of limited technology transfer and commercialization funds.</p>

The report shows that global emissions of greenhouse gases have risen to unprecedented levels despite a growing number of policies to reduce climate change. Emissions grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in each of the three previous decades. According to the report, it would be possible, using a wide array of technological measures and changes in behavior, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, only major institutional and technological change will give a better than even chance that global warming will not exceed this threshold.</p>

<p>Secretary Moniz issues a <a href="../articles/statement-secretary-moniz-ipccs-working-group-report-climate-change-mitigation.html">statement</a> on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Working Group report on climate change mitigation. The report, he says, “makes it clear that the next ten to twenty years are critical if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The IPCC report notes that it will be substantially more difficult to maintain low GHG concentrations in the long term if we do not act aggressively now. The report also points out that there are many low-carbon energy pathways to a prosperous future while mitigating climate change risks to a significant degree. Recognizing this imperative to act, the United States has been doing our part.”</p>

This dance affects groundwater quality, the fate of contaminants in the ground and the emerging science of carbon sequestration. Deep underground, microbes do not have much access to oxygen. So they have evolved ways to breathe other elements, including solid minerals like iron and sulfur. The part that interests scientists is that when the microbes breathe solid iron and sulfur, they transform them into highly reactive dissolved ions that are then much more likely to interact with other minerals and dissolved materials in the aquifer. This process can slowly but steadily make dramatic changes to the makeup of the rock, soil, and water.</p>

<p>The Department's Office of Inspector General (IG) <a href="../ig/downloads/audit-report-doeig-0911.html">issues</a> an <a href="../sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/DOE-IG-0911.pdf">Audit Report</a> on the cost and schedule of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site. The IG finds that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the contractor, MOX Services, have been largely unsuccessful in controlling the cost and schedule for the MOX Facility. A March 2012 construction project review conducted by NNSA concluded that the MOX Facility had a very low probability of being completed according to the approved baseline. NNSA directed MOX Services to develop a baseline change proposal with updated project completion, cost and schedule projections. Under the revised baseline, it was estimated that total project costs would grow to about $7.7 billion and that completion would slip to November 2019. This represents cost growth of about $2.9 billion and project schedule slippage of over 3 years. The anticipated cost and time required to complete the MOX Facility were significantly underestimated due to a number of factors. This included, most prominently, DOE’s 2007 approval of a project baseline that was developed from an immature design, understating the level of effort to install various construction commodity items, and high personnel turnover rates. Prior to approval, DOE’s own independent review of the project baseline found that the design review of the MOX Facility was incomplete. Additional work scope added at NNSA’s direction caused some of the cost growth in the baseline change proposal developed by MOX Services.</p>

The IG finds that DOE-funded science and energy research results were not always properly disseminated to the public. Financial assistance recipients had not always submitted final technical reports to the responsible office; unrestricted reports submitted to Energy Link—DOE’s system for collecting, reviewing and releasing technical reports and other forms of scientific and technical information—were not always reviewed and subsequently released publicly; and reports were not released after the expiration of associated data protection periods. These issues occurred due to weaknesses in DOE's processes for monitoring receipt of final reports from recipients, reviewing and releasing reports that have been received, addressing processing errors that prevent receipt or release of reports, and identifying and releasing reports upon expiration of data protection periods.</p>

The Department, as a result, began sending the waste to a Waste Control Specialist (WCS) facility in Andrews, Texas, for temporary storage until WIPP resumed operations. Shipments to WCS were halted when the investigation into the WIPP event identified a LANL drum as the possible cause. The Department also establishes a Technical Assistance Team of experts from across its national laboratories to perform a review of scientific and technical issues surrounding the incident at WIPP.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/bd4379a92ceceeac8525735900400c27/5bb6d20668b9a18485257ceb00490c98!OpenDocument">releases</a> its <a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan">Clean Power Plan</a> proposal, with proposed rules that for the first time cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, the single largest source of carbon pollution in the U.S. The plan will be implemented through a state-federal partnership under which states identify a path forward using either current or new electricity production and pollution control policies to meet the goals of the proposed program. The proposal provides guidelines for states to develop plans to meet state-specific goals to reduce carbon pollution and gives them the flexibility to design a program that makes the most sense for their unique situation. States can choose the right mix of generation using diverse fuels, energy efficiency and demand-side management to meet the goals and their own needs. It allows them to work alone to develop individual plans or to work together with other states to develop multi-state plans. Secretary Moniz says in a <a href="../articles/statement-energy-secretary-ernest-moniz-proposed-new-epa-rules-existing-power-plants.html">statement</a> that the rules “are a critical step toward addressing climate change.” The Department posts a <a href="../articles/epas-clean-power-plan-fight-climate-change-and-build-clean-energy-economy.html">blog article</a> on the plan.

The IG determines that the Department generally maintained the Reserve in a manner to ensure drawdown readiness. The IG nonetheless notes that it was not fully successful in meeting all of its operational performance criteria. The IG finds that due to the suspension and deferral of various maintenance and remediation activities, the Reserve was unable to achieve the maximum drawdown rate specified in its performance criteria, could not store oil at its full capacity, and had not ensured that its full inventory was available for drawdown. These conditions occurred, in part, because DOE had not performed a current, extensive assessment and therefore were not fully cognizant of the Reserve’s long-term sustainability. Budget cuts also contributed to the suspension of maintenance activities and resulted in the failure to maintain established drawdown rates and capacity.</p>

Key IEO2014 findings include: 1) World liquid fuels use is projected to grow from 87 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) in 2010 to 119 MMbbl/d in 2040, spurred by increased demand in the developing Asia and Middle East. 2) OPEC oil producers are the largest source of additional liquid fuel supply between 2010 and 2040, with OPEC crude and lease condensate accounts for 14 MMbbl/d of the 33 MMbbl/d increase in total liquid fuel supply. 3) Non-OPEC crude and lease condensate production increases by 10 MMbbl/d, with rising world oil prices attracting investment in areas previously considered uneconomic. Potential new supplies of oil from tight and shale resources have raised optimism for large, new sources of global liquid supplies to meet growing demand. Compared to previous reports, IEO2014 incorporates larger new supplies of tight oil from the U.S. and Canada. However, other countries, including Mexico, Russia, Argentina, and China, begin producing substantial volumes of tight oil prior to 2040.</p>

<p><em>Physics World</em>, an international monthly magazine published by the Institute of Physics, <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/physics-world-names-national-ignition-facility-fuel-gain-top-10-breakthrough-year">names the achievement of fuel gain</a> by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) one of its top 10 breakthroughs of the year. Ignition -- the process of releasing fusion energy equal to or greater than the amount of energy used to confine the fuel -- has long been considered the "holy grail" of inertial confinement fusion science. Before achieving ignition, a key step along the path is to have "fuel gains" greater than unity, where the energy generated through fusion reactions exceeds the amount of energy deposited into the fusion fuel and alpha-particle self-heating of the fusing region. NIF -- the world's largest and most energetic laser -- was the first facility to ever reach the milestone of achieving fuel gains greater than 1 with significant levels of alpha-heating.</p>
