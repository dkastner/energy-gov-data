<p>The Energy Department <a href="../eere/articles/energy-department-announces-25-million-improve-wind-forecasting.html">announces</a> $2.5 million for a new project to research the atmospheric processes that generate wind in mountain-valley regions. This in-depth research, conducted by Vaisala of Louisville, Colorado, will be used to improve the wind industry's weather models for short-term wind forecasts, especially for those issued less than 15 hours in advance. With access to better forecasts, wind energy plant operators and industry professionals can ensure wind turbines operate closer to maximum capacity, leading to lower energy costs for consumers. Data collected during the project will be shared in near real-time with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Energy Department's national laboratories, and will be used to develop improved atmospheric simulations for the <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.wrf-model.org%252Findex.php.html">Weather Research and Forecasting model</a>, a widely used weather prediction system.

<p>Secretary Ernest Moniz <a href="../articles/pushing-america-s-automotive-industry-forward.html">writes</a> in a blog post revealing that since 2009, the Energy Department has issued more than $8 billion in loans to companies through the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program, including $5.9 billion to the Ford Motor Company. The financing provided to Ford was used to upgrade 13 factories in six states to improve the fuel efficiency of popular models -- including the factory that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/01/08/heartbeat-american-manufacturing-president-obama-heads-michigan-talk-about-americas-">President Obama visited</a> in Detroit last week.

<p>A team from the Brookhaven National Laboratory and Columbia University has <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=11691">found a way</a> to improve the efficiency of solar cells by looking to design materials that can convert more lost heat energy into useful electricity. The team has paired up polymers that recover lost energy by producing two electrical charge carriers per unit of light instead of the usual one. "Critically, we show how this multiplication process can be made efficient on a single molecular polymer chain," said physicist Matthew Sfeir, who led the research at Brookhaven Lab's <a href="http://www.bnl.gov/cfn/">Center for Functional Nanomaterials</a> (CFN), a DOE Office of Science User Facility. Having the two charges on the same molecule means the light-absorbing, energy-producing materials don't have to be arrayed as perfect crystals to produce extra electrical charges. Instead, the self-contained materials work efficiently when dissolved in liquids, which opens the way for a wide range of industrial scale manufacturing processes, including "printing" solar-energy-producing material like ink. The research is published as an Advance Online Publication in Nature Materials,</p>

The release of the <em>Data Privacy and the Smart Grid: A Voluntary Code of Conduct</em> is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/12/fact-sheet-safeguarding-american-consumers-families">announced</a> as one of President Obama's next steps in his comprehensive approach to enhancing consumers’ security, tackling identity theft, and improving privacy online and in the classroom. During the development of the VCC, industry stakeholders attended open meetings and participated in work group activities to draft the VCC's principles. In September 2014, the Energy Department issued a Federal Register Notice announcing the availability of the draft VCC for public comment. The public comment period closed in October 2014. In December 2014, OE in coordination with the Federal Smart Grid Task Force conducted a webinar to conclude the development phase of the VCC.</p>

<p>The Obama Administration announcement that it would potentially allow some drilling off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts while barring it in some areas off of Alaska generates significant media coverage. Overall, the move is seen as a net benefit for the oil industry and, as the New York Times puts it, a “blow” to environmentalists. The coverage primarily focuses on the Atlantic coast proposal, with a secondary focus on the Alaska proposal and very little mention of the Gulf aspect. The <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2015%252F01%252F28%252Fus%252Fobama-plan-calls-for-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-the-atlantic.html%253Fref%253Dus.html" rel="nofollow" target="bipopup">New York Times</a> reports that the Administration “announced a proposal to open up coastal waters from Virginia to Georgia for oil and gas drilling” while also moving to “ban drilling in Alaska in some portions of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.” Opening the Atlantic coast to drilling is a “prize” long sought by oil companies and a “blow to environmental groups.” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said, “This is a balanced proposal that would make available nearly 80 percent of the undiscovered technically recoverable resources, while protecting areas that are simply too special to develop.”</p>

<p>The Interoperability of Demand Response Resources Demonstration in NY was awarded to Con Edison in 2009 as part of DOE's Smart Grid Demonstration Project (SGDP) grants funded by the Recovery Act. The objective of the project was to develop and demonstrate methodologies to enhance the ability of customer sited demand response resources, both conventional and renewable, to integrate more effectively with electric delivery companies. In order to achieve the project objective, interoperability between the delivery company and the demand response resources was achieved by integrating the operations of a demand response service provider, a large multi-facility retail customer, and a delivery company. The project focused on four main components: the Demand Response Command Center, the incremental Building Control Unit, the Thermal Storage Plant, and the Virtual Generator. All of these components were designed and configured to provide value to both the electric delivery company and the customer. The project ultimately showed that customer sited demand response resources can successfully be integrated into electric delivery company operation.

<p>Coverage of the passing of the deadline for an agreement on a preliminary framework in the Iranian nuclear talks is somewhat critical, with reports saying that while talks will continue into Wednesday and some sort of agreement is still possible, the lapsed timetable creates difficulties for the Obama Administration. Critics of the Administration’s Iran policy and supporters of tougher sanctions have criticized the failure to reach an agreement on time, and several analyses suggest that the US, eager to get something to show for the effort, is in a weakened position. Andrea Mitchell reported on <a href="https://media.bulletinintelligence.com/playclip.aspx?clipid=8d23a015892dadd&amp;pub=energy#201610031449272052541478&#039;)">NBC Nightly News  </a> that while negotiators missed the deadline, they made “enough progress, they said, to justify keeping at it until tomorrow.” However, Mitchell added, even if a deal is reached Wednesday, “the US will not get all of the specific commitments that it once hoped to get from Iran. That will make it harder to sell to critics who fear the Administration is making too many concessions.”</p>

America’s leading nuclear experts at the Department of Energy and its national labs and sites were involved throughout these negotiations, evaluating and developing technical proposals to help define negotiating positions in support of the US delegation. As a result, I’m pleased to say that we are very confident in the technical underpinnings of this arrangement.”</p>

But what we know is this – the planet is getting warmer. The science is indisputable. As a consequence, we know that wildfires are going to be more frequent and longer in intensity. That means more particulates in the air. That’s going to have respiratory impacts on people.” The President added that he is “trying to communicate...that there is a cost to inaction.” Dr. Jon LaPook, who conducted the interview, noted, “One reason for the new initiative may be that climate change legislation has stalled in Congress. The President told me political will typically does not come from the top-down.

Hydropower currently provides approximately seven percent of the U.S. electricity supply – enough to power more than 20 million homes, and has experienced significant growth industry-wide. Within the last decade, the industry has supported more than 55,000 direct domestic jobs across the country, and helped offset 200 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than 42 million passenger vehicles. The report also highlights how hydropower can be rapidly integrated with other renewable energy sources into the electric grid – contributing to the Administration’s goal of doubling our nation’s renewable energy supply again by 2020.</p>

<p>The National Nuclear Security Administration joins the Republic of Armenia to <a href="https://nnsa.energy.gov/node/12370">announce</a> the safe and secure removal of three unused radioactive sources from two locations in Yerevan, Armenia. The successful completion of the radioactive source recovery campaign was conducted by the Armenia Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ANRA). Since 2002, the NNSA’s Radiological Security Program has committed over two million dollars to Armenia in support of radiological security projects. Together, ANRA and NNSA have removed, identified and secured over 30,000 curies (Ci) of dangerous radiological materials from a total of nine locations. Government experts have determined that sources with as few as ten curies, if used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD), could result in extensive land denial and significant economic impact that requires a national response. This recovery campaign was accomplished through the combined efforts of Armenia’s Nuclear and Radiation Safety Center operating under ANRA and the NNSA’s Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation.</p>

They’re typically looking to capture 90 percent of their carbon, and as with Kemper, with multiple product streams, not just carbon. But if you look at the EPA’s proposed rule for new power plants that came out last year and you look at the target in terms of emissions, if you start with a very highly efficient coal plant, a new, ultra-super-critical plant, the amount of capture required to meet that proposed rule is roughly a third – a very far cry from 90-plus percent.” Moniz emphasized, when asked about the Obama Administration’s decision to let Shell drill in the Arctic, “We are committed to this low carbon world and are doing so within this ‘all of the above’ approach.” When asked by Politico, “Have we gone from dirty to clean, and is it all going to be one direction from here on in?” Moniz responded, “Oh, I think so, absolutely. And that is both policy- and technology-driven. Of course, we’re all working hard to go to Paris and to see ambitious declarations of targets backed up to the extent possible by credible implementation programs, globally. ... I think the pattern is very clear, and I think we are definitely heading toward a cleaner future.”</p>

In a papal encyclical that media characterized as long-awaited, controversial, and strongly worded, Francis blended religion and science while chiding those who deny the human role in the changing environment and criticizing the lack of positive action by governments and businesses. Coverage was widespread across the media. On <a href="https://media.bulletinintelligence.com/playclip.aspx?clipid=8d27813bbcb8134&amp;pub=energy#201610031621042052541478&#039;)">ABC World News  </a> David Muir reported that in a “controversial new report,” Pope Francis calls for “a revolution on climate change.” In what is “meant to be a teaching document for the Catholic Church,” the Pope says this is “a moral issue,” adding that “the earth has been turned into an immense pile of filth” and “fossil fuels are partly to blame.”</p>

<p>Secretary Ernest Moniz <a href="../articles/us-energy-secretary-moniz-statement-papal-encyclical-climate-change.html">releases a statement</a> regarding the release of a papal encyclical on climate change by Pope Francis, which begins: "Pope Francis' call to action on climate change is an important milestone in the global effort on this issue. His is not just a powerful moral voice, he also graduated as a chemical engineer and understands the consensus of climate scientists that accumulating man-made pollution endangers our planet and people around the world. As Pope Francis reminds us, we must push for ambitious and cost-effective solutions that protect us all, including those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.”</p>

The analysis found that the per-mile greenhouse gas emissions of an electric vehicle deployed as a self-driving, or autonomous, taxi in 2030 would be 63 to 82 percent lower than a projected 2030 hybrid vehicle driven as a privately owned car and 90 percent lower than a 2014 gasoline-powered private vehicle. Almost half of the savings is attributable to “right-sizing,” where the size of the taxi deployed is tailored to each trip’s occupancy needs.</p>

The funded research projects will assess the prospective geologic storage potential of offshore subsurface depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs and saline formations on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. These projects will use existing geologic and geophysical data to conduct a prospective storage resource assessment that will approximate the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be safely stored.</p>

<p>NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft accomplishes <a href="../articles/pluto-and-beyond-powering-new-horizons-3-billion-mile-journey.html">one of the most exciting feats in the history of space exploration</a>, with a little help from the Department of Energy. After a 9 1/2-year, 3-billion-mile journey, the mission’s historic flyby of Pluto has provided us with our first-ever closeup views of the frozen world at the edge of the solar system. New Horizons relies on a <a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/newhorizons.cfm">radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)</a>, a simple form of nuclear power, developed by the Energy Department. It takes heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 and converts it into electricity using devices called “thermocouples.” The RTG provides about 200 Watts of electricity to the spacecraft. The heat-producing ceramic “fuel pellets” of plutonium dioxide for the RTG—designed and safety-tested by Energy Department scientists—were manufactured at <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in New Mexico, with special iridium and graphite shielding provided by <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in Tennessee. The plutonium-238 itself came from the <a href="http://www.srs.gov/">Savannah River Site</a> in South Carolina, which produced nuclear fuel for NASA's space missions for nearly three decades. The final product was assembled at <a href="https://www.inl.gov/">Idaho National Laboratory</a> in September 2005, just three years after the Energy Department decided to relocate its RTG program there in 2002. That’s especially impressive when you consider that an entirely new facility needed to be constructed before the team could even begin to build and test the RTG for New Horizons.</p>

<p>Distinguished Fellow Ali Erdemir and his team at the Argonne National Laboratory <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1UCSvub">receive a patent</a> for an ultra-fast surface hardening technology that could greatly extend the lifetime of mechanical parts. To protect machinery and increase longevity, several methods of surface hardening have been developed including pack-boriding, which lays down a boride layer on metal pieces through the diffusion of boron. Erdemir’s work is a departure from this conventional boriding technique, which is both time-consuming and energy-intensive. Instead, his team came up with a process for ultra-fast boriding, a process that saves time, money and energy, and even alleviates environmental concerns.</p>

<p>This week marks the <a href="https://nnsa.energy.gov/node/12760">20th anniversary</a> of President Bill Clinton’s announcement that the United States would pursue negotiations for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal without nuclear explosive tests. President Clinton stated that the maintenance of a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile was “a supreme national interest” of the United States, and that the Department of Energy and the national nuclear design laboratories had assured him that the United States “can meet the challenge of maintaining [its] nuclear deterrent under a CTBT through a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP).” On September 24, 1996, the United States was the first nation to sign the CTBT. The United States Senate has not yet ratified the CTBT. “This 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary is an important milestone. The science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program was and remains successful thanks to the vision and determination of its proponents and the significant investment in the necessary tools, facilities, and people. The men and women employed by the national nuclear labs and production plants have achieved this goal with decades of hard work, ingenuity, and unmatched science and engineering,” said Lt. Gen. (Retired) Frank G. Klotz, Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and Administrator, National Nuclear Security Administration. “Our Nation maintains the safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent necessary for national security. Today, we have a greater understanding of how nuclear weapons perform than we did when we were actually conducting nuclear explosive tests.”</p>

<p>Using physical chemistry methods to look at biology at the nanoscale, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researcher announces the <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1fmTT4b">invention of a new technology</a> to image single molecules with unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution, thus leading to the first “true-color” super-resolution microscope. Ke Xu, a faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Life Sciences Division, has dubbed his innovation SR-STORM, or spectrally resolved stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. Because SR-STORM gives full spectral and spatial information for each molecule, the technology opens the door to high-resolution imaging of multiple components and local chemical environments, such as pH variations, inside a cell.</p>

The Carbon Capture Program is developing technologies that will enable cost-effective implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the power generation sector and ensure that the United States will continue to have access to safe, reliable, and affordable energy from fossil fuels. The program consists of two core research technology areas, post-combustion capture and pre-combustion capture, and also supports related CO<sub>2</sub> compression efforts. Current research and development efforts are advancing technologies that could provide step-change reductions in both cost and energy penalty compared to currently available technologies. The selected projects focus on advancing the development of a suite of post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture and supersonic compression systems for new and existing coal-based electric generating plants, specifically: (1) supersonic compression systems, (2) small pilot-scale (from 0.5 to 5 MWe) post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture development and testing, and (3) large pilot-scale (from 10 to more than 25 MWe) post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture development and testing.</p>

<p>For their work on the development, transfer, and successful commercialization of a novel platinum-chromium alloy used in next-generation coronary stents, scientists at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), and their colleagues, are <a href="../fe/articles/techline-netl-scientists-honored-asm-international-work-platinum-chromium-alloy-coronary.html">honored</a> with a 2015 ASM Engineering Materials Achievement Award from the materials science and engineering society ASM International. The team received the award at a banquet held in conjunction with the 2015 Materials Science and Technology meeting in Columbus, Ohio. NETL’s Edward Argetsinger, Jeffrey Hansen, Paul Jablonski, and Paul Turner developed the alloy in collaboration with researchers at Boston Scientific Corporation. It is the first stainless steel formulation for stents with a significant concentration of platinum, making it easier for coronary specialists to see the stent on x-ray during placement and expansion. The alloy also increases the stents’ corrosive resistance, strength and flexibility.</p>

DOE found that Friedrich’s room air conditioner model SQ10N10 consumed more energy than permitted under the applicable standard.  Friedrich ceased manufacturing and distributing the model and has notified purchasers about the product’s noncompliance.</p>

Let’s go to Paris and then we’ll do it.” Politico adds, “But getting the Senate to revisit – let alone ratify – the treaty is set to run into a buzz saw in Congress.” After hearing of the plan, Sen.

Moreover, with 2,700 structures already on its list, officials say more than 350 facilities controlled by other Department programs could be eligible for transfer to the operation, but the program is not taking on additional projects for now regardless of their significance, meaning some the gravest problems could go unaddressed for decades in favor of lower-priority work. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, earlier this year, appointed a working group to examine what is the best way to handle all the buildings that have been contaminated.

<p>Researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1YnMJg8">announce</a> they have demonstrated that diamonds may hold the key to the future for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies. In a study led by Alexander Pines, a senior faculty scientist with Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division and UC Berkeley’s Glenn T. Seaborg Professor of Chemistry, researchers recorded the first bulk room-temperature NMR hyperpolarization ​of carbon-13 nuclei in diamond <em>in situ</em> at arbitrary magnetic fields and crystal orientations. The signal of the hyperpolarized carbon-13 spins showed an enhancement of NMR/MRI signal sensitivity by many orders of magnitude above what is ordinarily possible with conventional NMR/MRI magnets at room temperature. Furthermore, this hyperpolarization was achieved with microwaves, rather than relying on precise magnetic fields for hyperpolarization transfer.</p>

<p>Scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the University of Washington <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1NU55jU">create</a> a new material that quickly separates electrons and their holes, providing a key insight for solar fuel production. To create a material where the electrons and holes are forced to separate, the team produced an artificial crystal structure called a superlattice. The ability of these superlattice stacks to separate electrons and holes was first predicted in 2000 by Kaspar's colleague Dr. Scott Chambers, but no practical applications were envisioned at the time. Further study led to an understanding of the interfacial properties between the hematite and chromium oxide layers. This work proved relevant to the recent interest in using hematite to produce solar fuels, prompting Kaspar and colleagues to create and test the superlattice stacks. </p>

<p>In its look ahead at 2016 research trends, <a href="../exit@url=http%253A%252F%252Fnews.sciencemag.org%252Fscientific-community%252F2015%252F12%252Flook-ahead-2016-what-research-trends-will-be-hot-and-what-will-not.html" rel="nofollow" target="bipopup">Science Magazine</a> reports a positive outlook for DOE labs. From 2009 to 2013, former Energy Secretary Steven Chu “tried to reinvent how the Department of Energy addresses energy science by developing ‘hubs,’ Bell Labs–like centers designed to tackle specific problems.” The article reports current Secretary Ernest Moniz “has kept existing hubs but has focused on optimizing the performance of DOE’s 16 national labs.”</p>
