<p>Scientists at the Department's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1RsVntq">announce</a> they have produced self-consistent computer simulations that capture the evolution of an electric current inside fusion plasma without using a central electromagnet, or solenoid. The simulations of the process, known as non-inductive current ramp-up, were performed using TRANSP, the gold-standard code developed at PPPL. The results were published in October 2015 in Nuclear Fusion. The research was supported by the DOE Office of Science.</p>

<p>The DOE <a href="../articles/energy-department-selects-battelle-team-deep-borehole-field-test-north-dakota.html">selects</a> a Battelle Memorial Institute-led team to drill a test borehole of over 16,000 feet into a crystalline basement rock formation near Rugby, North Dakota. This is an important step in exploring the science needed for utilization of deep boreholes in crystalline rock formations. One of the most promising applications is the potential for disposal of certain types of high-level radioactive wastes; another could be geothermal energy development. The field test will provide insights into crosscutting subsurface science and engineering challenges such as drilling techniques, wellbore stability and sealing, and subsurface characterization.</p>

<p>A team of researchers led by scientists from the Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1THiek5">announce</a> they have identified several mechanisms that make a new, cold-loving material one of the toughest metallic alloys ever. The alloy is made of chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel, so scientists call it CrMnFeCoNi. It’s exceptionally tough and strong at room temperature, which translates into excellent ductility, tensile strength, and resistance to fracture. And unlike most materials, the alloy becomes tougher and stronger the colder it gets, making it an intriguing possibility for use in cryogenic applications such as storage tanks for liquefied natural gas.</p>

<p>Scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1ZazRdA">report</a> they followed the journey of atmospheric particles within anvil-shaped storm kings called convective clouds, and analyzed how well the model could simulate the particles' travels. The researchers have devised a new modeling approach that tackles a couple of particle problems: how they are moved to the upper troposphere (about 5-6 miles above Earth), and how efficiently they leave the atmosphere inside droplets, rain, or snow.</p>

<p>A study at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1RpIi63">shows</a> how calcium carbonate forms composites to make strong materials such as in shells and pearls. The results or the study show that such clumps become incorporated via chemical interactions with atoms in the crystals, an unexpected mechanism based on previous understanding. By providing insight into the formation of natural minerals that are a composite of both soft and hard components, the work is believed to have the potential to help scientists develop new materials for a sustainable energy future, based on this principle.</p>

<p>A team of scientists from the Department's Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1Oe4fRp">say they've found a way to build a better battery</a>. While increasing the amounts of chemicals whose reactions power the battery can lead to instability, and smaller particles can improve reactivity but expose more material to degradation, the team found that their test batteries incorporating a two-level cathode exhibited improved high-voltage cycling behavior—the kind you'd want for fast-charging electric vehicles and other applications that require high-capacity storage. The scientists describe the micro-to-nanoscale details of the cathode material in a paper published in the journal <em>Nature Energy</em> January 11, 2016. </p>

Late last month Moniz wrote to White House budget director Shaun Donovan to reconsider the proposed fiscal 2017 budget because it “would not be responsible to submit a budget with such obvious programmatic gaps.” Without the necessary funding, the budget will not have “credibility with Congress and stakeholders” and will “fuel uncertainty” within the National Nuclear Security Administration. But the Administration is only requesting half the funding needed for nuclear facilities between the years of 2018 and 2021. In his letter Moniz also expressed concern about high-tech aspects of the nuclear program.

<p>Researchers at the Department’s BioEnergy Science Center are looking beyond the usual suspects in the search for microbes that can efficiently break down inedible plant matter for conversion to biofuels. A <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1nlvG2P">new comparative study</a> from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory-based center finds the natural abilities of unconventional bacteria could help boost the efficiency of cellulosic biofuel production. A team of researchers from five institutions analyzed the ability of six microorganisms to solubilize potential bioenergy feedstocks such as switchgrass that have evolved strong defenses against biological and chemical attack. Solubilization prepares the plant feedstocks for subsequent fermentation and, ultimately, use as fuel. The paper, published in <em>Biotechnology for Biofuels</em>, is the most comprehensive comparative study of its type to date. </p>

<p>Scientists have for the<a href="http://1.usa.gov/1TH7aFT"> first time</a> reengineered a building block of a geometric nanocompartment that occurs naturally in bacteria. Researchers at the Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory devised synthetic shell structures derived from those found in a rod-shaped, ocean-dwelling bacterium, <em>Haliangium ochraceum</em>, and reengineered one of the shell proteins to serve as a scaffold for an iron-sulfur cluster found in many forms of life. The cluster is known as a “cofactor” because it can serve as a helper molecule in biochemical reactions. They introduced a metal binding site to its shell that will allow electrons to be transferred to and from the compartment. This provides an entirely new functionality, greatly expanding the potential of nanocompartments to serve as custom-made chemical factories. Scientists hope to tailor this new use to produce high-value chemical products, such as medicines, on demand.</p>

The researchers found that the fungi adapt their enzymes to wood, grass, agricultural waste, or whatever scientists feed it. The <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1QOB31L">findings</a> suggest that industry could modify the gut fungi so that they produce improved enzymes that will outperform the best available ones, potentially leading to cheaper biofuels and bio-based products. To make the finding, O’Malley drew upon two Department of Energy Office of Science User Facilities: the Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the DOE Joint Genome Institute. O’Malley’s study is the first to result from a partnership between the two facilities called Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science or <a href="http://jgi.doe.gov/collaborate-with-jgi/community-science-program/how-to-propose-a-csp-project/emsl/">FICUS</a>. The partnership allows scientists around the world to draw on capabilities at both SC user facilities to get a more complete understanding of fundamental scientific questions. O’Malley’s team also included scientists from PNNL, DOE JGI, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Harper Adams University.</p>

<p>A multi-institution team is <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2016/03/08/illuminating-the-universes-ignition/">using the supercomputing resources</a> at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility to simulate 10 million years of cosmic time, tracking evolving properties of galaxies to understand the epoch of reionization as galaxies formed after the Big Bang. The researchers’ goal was to learn about reionization across the universe, while predicting its imprints that can be observed today on these nearby celestial objects. Astronomers think that when dwarf galaxies much smaller than the Milky Way were engulfed by reionization, for example, their star formation was suppressed. If the team’s newest simulation confirmed this, it would solve a major puzzle in the standard theory of cosmology.

<p>A new, highly permeable carbon capture membrane developed by scientists from the Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory could <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1XAjgA0">reportedly</a> lead to more efficient ways of separating carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust, preventing the greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. In a first, the scientists engineered the membrane so that carbon dioxide molecules can travel through it via two distinct channels. Molecules can travel through the polymer component of the membrane, like they do in conventional gas-separation membranes. Or molecules can flow through “carbon dioxide highways” created by adjacent metal-organic frameworks. Initial tests show this two-route approach makes the hybrid membrane eight times more carbon dioxide permeable than membranes composed only of the polymer. Boosting carbon dioxide permeability is a big goal in efforts to develop carbon capture materials that are energy efficient and cost competitive.

<p>Scientists at the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1U9g0O4">report</a> they have discovered a way to use a microscopic swirling flow to rapidly clear a circle of tiny bacteria or swimming robots. "This discovery offers a new approach for control and manipulation of microscopic swimmers," said Argonne physicist and co-author Igor Aronson, and it could be useful in tiny microfluidic ("lab-on-a-chip") devices that can quickly run chemical or biological analyses or perform tasks. In the study, published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, the researchers placed a magnetic particle in the center of a liquid film filled with swimming bacteria. Normally the bacteria swim randomly; but when scientists spun the particle by applying a rotating magnetic field, the swimmers shot away from the center, like a school of fish that suddenly realized there's a shark in their midst. This technique could separate live from dead bacteria, or different species, bacterial strains or mutants from one another. "The shape and swimming rates of different species would mean they separate," Aronson said.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://1.usa.gov/22IFnaR">new study</a> by scientists at the Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reveals that much more is going on at the microscopic level of cloud formation than previously thought. The scientists determined that organic molecules effectively depressed the surface tension of the water, allowing for more efficient formation of bigger cloud droplets. “Conventional wisdom says that the water solubility of the aerosol is the key factor in the formation of cloud droplets,” said study senior author Kevin Wilson, the deputy director of science at Berkeley Lab’s Chemical Sciences Division. “The more easily a particle dissolves in water, the easier it is for a cloud droplet to form. What we’re finding is that relying upon solubility alone doesn’t always work. Our study suggests that what the aerosol is doing at the interface with water is what matters in accurately predicting whether it will go on to form cloud droplets.” The findings, to be published in the March 25 issue of the journal <em>Science</em>, could improve the accuracy of climate change models that predict the potential cooling effect of reflective clouds based upon the particles in the air.</p>

The Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) program provides hands-on training and extensive education for undergraduate and graduate engineering students in manufacturing processes, energy assessment procedures, and energy management systems. Led by engineering faculty, the selected IACs will perform on-site assessments at small- and medium-sized manufacturing business partners, currently defined as having gross annual sales below $100 million, fewer than 500 employees, and annual energy bills between $100,000 and $2.5 million. Energy, productivity, water-resource use, and waste assessments will be conducted by students and faculty of the IACs as a service to the participating companies. In exchange for hosting the hands-on assessment training opportunities for students, these small- and medium-sized manufacturers receive an assessment that the company can use to improve their operations.  When implemented, the recommended actions will result in energy and water savings, waste reduction, opportunities for smart manufacturing, and potential enhancements to cyber security and related information technologies, as well as sustainability and productivity improvements for these manufacturers at the heart of the U.S. economy.</p>

The access to such a protocol or pre standard by any SDO significantly reduces the time it can take to develop and process formal consensus standards. In addition, until formal standards are completed and published, such a protocol provides a ‘benchmark’ for addressing ESS performance. This fills a gap that, if left unfilled, presents a challenge to anyone interested in uniformly and accurately assessing ESS performance and comparing systems.</p>

These new measurements were carried out by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III. Shaped by a continuous tug-of-war between dark matter and dark energy, the map revealed by BOSS allows scientists to measure the expansion rate of the Universe and thus determine the amount of matter and dark energy that make up the present-day Universe.

In experiments reported today in <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>, sunlight falling on the little device triggered the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other disinfecting chemicals that killed more than 99.999 percent of bacteria in just 20 minutes. When their work was done the killer chemicals quickly dissipated, leaving pure water behind.</p>

He said the problem of the aging fleet must be addressed, perhaps by more relicensing. He said the nuclear industry has to figure out how to operate in a “decarbonized electricity system,” where the need for baseload power may be lessened.
