 <title>PSH-16-0080 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>

 <title>PSH-16-0083 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/psh-16-0083-matter-personnel-security-hearing</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0083-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0083 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 31, 2017, an OHA Administrative Judge issued a decision in which he determined that an individual’s DOE access authorization should be restored.  The individual disclosed in a Questionnaire for National Security Positions that he submitted in 2015 that he had used marijuana on two occasions in 2010 while holding a DOE security clearance.  However, the Administrative Judge found that several factors cited in the Adjudicative Guidelines provided mitigation of the concerns raised by the individual’s marijuana use in 2010.  Specifically, the Administrative Judge found that a sufficient time has passed since the last occurrence of his marijuana use, and that his marijuana use, which occurred only twice, was infrequent.  Accordingly, the Administrative Judge concluded that the individual’s marijuana use is highly unlikely to recur and, therefore, does not cast doubt upon the individual’s present reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Therefore, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved the security concerns.  OHA Case No. PSH-16-0083 (Steven L. Fine - Administrative Judge)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSH-16-0078 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/psh-16-0078-matter-personnel-security-hearing</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0078-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0078 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 23, 2017, an Administrative Judge (AJ) issued a decision in which he concluded that an individual’s access authorization should not be restored. In reaching this determination, the AJ found that the individual had not resolved security concerns under Guidelines G and J of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information. Under Guideline G, which relates to excessive alcohol consumption, the AJ concluded that the individual’s six months of responsible behavior regarding alcohol were insufficient to demonstrate rehabilitation or reformation from his alcohol use disorder, given the individual’s lengthy history of abusive drinking. Regarding Guideline J, which concerns illegal behavior, the AJ found that since the individual’s chances of returning to an abusive pattern of drinking were unacceptably high, his chances of engaging in future alcohol-related illegal activity were also unacceptably high. Consequently, the AJ found that the individual’s security clearance should not be restored.  OHA Case No. Case No. PSH-16-0078 (Robert B. Palmer - Administrative Judge)     &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSH-16-0084  - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/psh-16-0084-matter-personnel-security-hearing</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0084-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0084  - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 13, 2017, an Administrative Judge (AJ) issued a decision in which he determined that an individual’s access authorization should be restored.  The individual had accumulated medical debts as the result of hospitalization in 2012 and had not repaid them by July 2016.  The Local Security Office (LSO) conducted a Personnel Security Interviews (PSI) of the individual in July 2016 to address concerns about his financial irresponsibility, as demonstrated in part by his failure to carry through on his commitments to address his debts made during a 2013 OPM interview.   At the hearing, the individual testified that he was laid off for much of the two years following the 2013 OPM interview, and his wife was laid off at the same time.  She later filed for disability benefits, retroactive to 2013.  He established that the cause of his indebtedness was his hospitalization followed by periods of unemployment, both of which were beyond his control.    He did not address his debts as he had promised because, once laid off, he had no surplus income with which to pay any debts; moreover, they anticipated resolving those debts by using his wife’s lump-sum payment for retroactive disability, which they had been assured would be issued promptly.  By July 2016, he understood that those payments were not forthcoming in the near future, and arranged to repay all his outstanding debts by refinancing his mortgage.  At the time of the hearing, he had paid all his creditors and had steady work unlikely to be interrupted by future layoffs.  In addition, he and his wife live frugally, carry no current debt, and can meet all their expenses regardless to whether she receives disability benefits. After reviewing the testimony, the AJ determined that the individual had resolved the LSO’s security concerns under Criterion L.  OHA Case No. PSH-16-0084 (William Schwartz, Administrative Judge)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSH-16-0074 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>

 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0074-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0074 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 11, 2017, an OHA Administrative Judge issued a decision in which she determined that an individual’s access authorization should be restored.  In reaching this determination, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved the security concerns arising from his failure to file and pay his 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014 Federal income taxes.  The individual and his current tax advisor testified that he filed his 2007 and 2008 tax returns, but that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had no record of having received them.  The tax advisor testified that it is not uncommon for the IRS to lose returns.  She also stated that she was familiar with his previous tax preparer and is convinced that he filed the returns.  As to the 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns, the individual and his tax advisor testified that he had difficulty finding someone to file the returns for him because he had a Limited Liability Corporation that made the returns more difficult.  In addition, his wife, from whom he is separated but not divorced, refused to provide necessary information to file the returns.  The individual and his tax advisor both testified that the individual is now current with the filing of his returns and is just waiting to hear from the Internal Revenue Service regarding penalties and interest.  Therefore, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved the Criterion L concerns.  OHA Case No. PSH-16-0074 (Janet R.

 <title>PSH-16-0079 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/psh-16-0079-matter-personnel-security-hearing</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0079-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0079 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 6, 2017, an Administrative Judge issued a decision restoring an individual’s access authorization. In reaching this determination, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved security concerns under Criterion L regarding her failure to file Federal and State income tax returns from 2011 to 2015. The individual introduced testimony establishing that, in 2009, she moved her mother into her home in order to provide medical care. The individual also produced evidence establishing that given the requirements of her regular employment and the extra burden of caring for her mother, the individual became overwhelmed. Additional testimony established that when the individual’s mother passed away, and her brother passed away shortly thereafter, the individual became “traumatized.” The individual also presented testimony from her accountant indicating that the individual has filed all of the tax returns in question and that she was owed a refund for each of those years. The individual’s Division Leader and Manager testified as to the individual’s excellent work performance and their belief in the individual’s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Given the evidence before him, the Administrative Judge found that the individual’s failure to file 2011 to 2015 Federal and State tax returns was an event triggered by extraordinary circumstances not likely to be repeated. Consequently, the Administrative Judge found that the individual’s security clearance should be restored. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSH-16-0066  - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/psh-16-0066-matter-personnel-security-hearing</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0066-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0066  - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On November 30, 2016, an OHA Administrative Judge issued a decision in which he concluded that an individual’s security clearance should be restored. The local security office (LSO) alleged that the individual (who has held access authorization for approximately 30 years) violated workplace rules on four occasions, had been delinquent on his home mortgage for at least five years, and had failed to honor commitments he made to DOE during personnel security interviews (PSIs) between 2011 and 2015. After examination of the record as a whole, including the testimony of all witnesses (which included two personnel security specialists), the Administrative Judge concluded: (1) each of the workplace violations occurred under unique circumstances and that such behavior was unlikely to recur; (2) the individual’s mortgage delinquencies commenced due to circumstances beyond his control (i.e., loss of income through unemployment and, subsequently, prioritizing payment of federal and state tax debt) and the individual’s continual attempts to effectuate a mortgage modification evidenced a good faith effort to resolve his mortgage delinquency; and (3) the LSO’s own documentation largely refuted the allegations that the individual had failed to honor commitments he had made during PSIs. On this basis, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved all of the security concerns alleged under Criterion L.  OHA Case No. PSH-16-0066 (Wade M. Boswell) &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PSH-16-0072 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing</title>

 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/psh-16-0072-matter-personnel-security-hearing&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSH-16-0072 - In the Matter of Personnel Security Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On November 22, 2016, an OHA Administrative Judge issued a decision in which she determined that an individual’s access authorization should be restored.  In reaching this determination, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved the security concerns arising from a diagnosis that the individual suffers from Alcohol Abuse, a mental condition which causes, or may cause, a significant defect in judgment or reliability.  In addition, the Local Security Office (LSO) found that individual had engaged in questionable conduct when he knowingly consumed alcohol even though his May 2015 Simple Assault arrest required abstinence.  Further, the LSO found that the individual’s May 2008 and May 2015 Simple Assault arrests and November 2015 Driving Under the Influence arrest raised security concerns regarding the individual’s trustworthiness and reliability.  The individual’s witnesses testified that the individual is extremely trustworthy and honest.  The individual testified that he was upset about his failing marriage, which ultimately ended in divorce, when he consumed alcohol in November 2015.  It was the first and only time he consumed alcohol while required to maintain abstinence after his May 2015 Simple Assault arrest.  After hearing all the testimony, the DOE psychologist testified that the individual was reformed from his Alcohol Abuse diagnosis.  She was impressed with his support system and that he recognized that his marriage had been toxic for him.  Therefore, the Administrative Judge found that the individual had resolved the Criteria H, J, and L security concerns.  OHA Case No. PSH-16-0072 (Janet R.
