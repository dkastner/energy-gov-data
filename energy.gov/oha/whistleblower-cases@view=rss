 <title>WBU-16-0008 - In the Matter of Jim Kapsales	</title>

Chew, to terminate its subcontract with Mr. Kapsales.  In dismissing the complaint, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) concluded that Mr. Kapsales had not alleged any facts upon which relief could be granted.  On Appeal, OHA found, considering all arguments and supporting evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Kapsales, that dismissal was appropriate.  Accordingly, OHA denied the Appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

(BWXT) under the DOE’s Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 CFR Part 708. In his Complaint, Mr. Dalton alleged that he reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the DOE’s Inspector General (IG) various problems with the techniques used by BWXT to inspect the fuel elements it supplies to its customers, including DOE. He further alleged that, in response to his disclosures to the NRC and the IG, managers at BWXT criticized him for his disclosures in a memo sent to colleagues and that a manager threatened to take disciplinary action. In its dismissal, the IOO concluded that Mr. Dalton had not alleged that BWXT took some adverse action that could qualify as retaliation under Part 708. However, OHA found that considering all materials in a light most favorable to Mr. Dalton, it could not conclude that Mr. Dalton had failed to allege an act of retaliation. Accordingly, OHA granted the Appeal and remanded the matter to the IOO for further processing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WBU-16-0006 - In the Matter Dr. Shou-Yuan Zhang</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/wbu-16-0006-matter-dr-shou-yuan-zhang</link>

In his Complaint, Dr. Zhang alleged that in an email to a BSA official, he reported research misconduct and that, in response, BSA transferred him to a new position. The DOE’s Brookhaven Site Office (BHSO) dismissed the Complaint on the grounds that Dr. Zhang had not made a disclosure protected by Part 708 and that BSA had offered Dr. Zhang remedies that were equivalent either to the remedies he sought or the remedies available under Part 708. On appeal, OHA found that, considering all materials in a light most favorable to Dr. Zhang, it could not conclude that Dr. Zhang had not made a protected disclosure. OHA further found that it did not appear as if the remedies offered by BSA were such that dismissal at this stage was merited. Accordingly, OHA granted the Appeal and remanded the matter to the BHSO for further processing. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WBU-16-0004 - In the Matter of Richard Lusby</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/wbu-16-0004-matter-richard-lusby</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/wbu-16-0004-matter-richard-lusby&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBU-16-0004 - In the Matter of Richard Lusby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On May 16, 2016, OHA denied an Appeal of a dismissal of a Complaint filed by Richard Lusby against Savannah River Nuclear Solutions (SRNS) under the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 CFR Part 708.  In his Complaint, Mr. Lusby alleged that SRNS had failed to hire him for several positions for which he had applied.  He further alleged that the contractor’s actions constituted retaliation for his prior Notice of Employee Concern, filed with SNRS on July 24, 2013.  In that prior concern, Mr. Lusby had alleged that he was improperly forced to vacate his position, and moved to a lesser position.  He alleged that his supervisor had lied to management, stating that Lusby had “volunteered” to leave his position.  In his present complaint, he cites this alleged lie as the protected disclosure giving rise to the current alleged retaliation.  The DOE Savannah River Operations (SRO) Office of Employee Concerns dismissed the complaint on the basis that the facts did not present issues for which relief can be granted under 10 CFR Part 708.  On appeal, OHA agreed with the SRO that Mr. Lusby had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Specifically, OHA found that Mr. Lusby’s alleged disclosures did not constitute protected disclosures under Part 708. Consequently, OHA denied Mr. Lusby’s Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WBU-16-0001 - In the Matter Robert Schweiger</title>

 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/wbu-16-0001-matter-robert-schweiger&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBU-16-0001 - In the Matter Robert Schweiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On March 4, 2016, OHA denied an Appeal of a dismissal of a Complaint filed by Robert Schweiger against Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) under the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 C.F.R. Part 708.  In his Complaint, Mr. Schweiger alleged that BNI denied him training, treated him disrespectfully and ultimately terminated him because he had complained about the quality of his supervisor and BNI management, and because he had revealed that he acted as a whistleblower under a different employer about 20 years earlier. The DOE’s Office of River Protection (ORP), citing 10 C.F.R. § 708.17(c)(2), found Mr. Schweiger had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  It therefore dismissed the Complaint due to lack of jurisdiction.  On appeal, OHA agreed with the ORP that Mr. Schweiger had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Specifically, OHA found that Mr. Schweiger’s alleged disclosures did not constitute protected disclosures under Part 708. Consequently, OHA denied Mr. Schweiger’s Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WBA-15-0009 - In the Matter of Sandra Black</title>

 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/wba-15-0009-matter-sandra-black&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBA-15-0009 - In the Matter of Sandra Black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On December 31, 2015, OHA denied an Appeal involving a Complaint filed by Sandra Black against Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS) under the DOE’s Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 CFR Part 708. In her Complaint, Black alleged SRNS terminated her for engaging in protected activities, specifically citing her participation in a Government Accountability Office review as a protected disclosure. An OHA Attorney-Investigator dismissed Black’s Complaint because she also filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor based on “the same facts” as alleged in the Part 708 complaint. On review, OHA affirmed the finding of the OHA Attorney-Investigator that OHA lacked jurisdiction over Black’s complaint pursuant to 10 CFR §§ 708.15(c), (d) and 708.17(c)(3). Consequently, OHA denied Black’s Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WBA-14-0001 - In the Matter of Krishnan Balasubramanian</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/wba-14-0001-matter-krishnan-balasubramanian</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/wba-14-0001-matter-krishnan-balasubramanian&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBA-14-0001 - In the Matter of Krishnan Balasubramanian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On December 28, 2015, OHA denied an Appeal involving a Complaint filed by Krishnan Balasubramanian (Balasubramanian) against Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), management and operating contractor for DOE’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the DOE’s Contractor Employee Protection Program and its governing regulations set forth at 10 CFR Part 708.  Following Balasubramanian’s third request for a health-related postponement of his Part 708 hearing, an OHA Administrative Judge dismissed Balasubramanian’s Complaint without prejudice, subject to Balasubramanian refiling his Complaint with OHA by June 1, 2015. On May 29, 2015, Balasubramanian filed a fourth request for a health-related postponement, without refiling his Complaint. The Administrative Judge noted that the medical documentation submitted by Balasubramanian would normally have been sufficient to conclude that medical necessity warranted granting the requested postponement. However, in this case, Balasubramanian had filed a state court action against LLNS following the earlier dismissal of his Part 708 Complaint and, in light of his ability to commence a state court litigation, the Administrative Judge saw no basis to conclude that Balasubramanian had been unable to refile his Part 708 Complaint by the June 1st deadline. On review, OHA affirmed the decision, noting that the state court filing and related correspondence evidenced Balasubramanian’s willingness and capability to participate in work-related communications and proceedings, which his physician had certified he needed to be freed from completely. Consequently, Balasubramanian’s Appeal was denied. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WBZ-14-0012 - In the Matter of UChicago Argonne LLC </title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oha/downloads/wbz-14-0012-matter-uchicago-argonne-llc</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/oha/downloads/wbz-14-0012-matter-uchicago-argonne-llc&quot; class=&quot;title-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBZ-14-0012 - In the Matter of UChicago Argonne LLC &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On July 21, 2015, an OHA Administrative Judge granted in part and denied in part a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by UChicago Argonne LLC (Argonne).  In its Motion, Argonne sought dismissal of a Part 708 complaint filed by Jonathan McKay against the contractor on several grounds.  After considering the parties’ full briefing of this matter, the Administrative Judge determined that: (1) Argonne’s alleged retaliatory acts that occurred more than 90 days before Mr. McKay filed his complaint would not be dismissed from the proceeding, because the bases for those acts were inextricably intertwined with those that supported his termination, which occurred less than 90 days before he filed his complaint; (2) genuine issues of material fact existed concerning Mr. McKay’s allegations of fraud, gross mismanagement, and abuse of authority; and (3) genuine issues of material fact existed concerning whether Argonne would have taken the same actions against Mr. McKay if he had not made his disclosures.  The Administrative Judge also determined, however, that (4) there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning Mr. McKay’s allegations of disclosing violations of a law, rule, or regulation, because the company directives on which Mr. McKay relied were found not to be laws, rules, or regulations for purposes of Part 708.  Consequently, the Administrative Judge denied the Motion with respect to the first three issues and granted the Motion with respect to the fourth, dismissing those allegations from the proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
