<p>The Chief Storyteller® </p>
<p>It all began some 30 years ago, at a high school science fair. Ira Koretsky had presented his computer program on the heart and the circulatory system. One by one, the prizes were announced... third...second...first place. After nearly 100 hours of programming evenings and weekends, he slumped his shoulders and thought to himself, “I lost.” Then...Ira heard the chairwoman announce, “We are awarding the grand prize to a young man who could sell me my own pair of shoes!” And his name was called...In hindsight, this event helped put him on the path to a career in communications.</p>
<p>He was a US Army Captain in the Medical Service Corps serving as both a public affairs officer (PAO) and chief information officer (CIO) in the military health system. He designed presentations for himself and over 40 military and civilian executives in technology and healthcare. At just 21 years of age, he gained invaluable insights into messaging, communications, and storytelling. Ira has held various leadership roles in marketing and product management. After earning his MBA from the University of Maryland, Ira entered into the world of leading edge technology in the San Francisco and Silicon Valley areas. It is there he started The Chief Storyteller® in 2002.</p>
<p>Like all good communicators, Ira loves the stage. He performed improvisational humor professionally with ComedySportz in a career spanning 12 years and more than 1,000 shows. He put to good use these skills as an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland Robert H. Smith School of Business and has continued to guest lecture at Maryland along with George Washington and Georgetown universities.</p>
<p>Ira improves your individual and organizational performance. You’re sure to be inspired by his mantra, “Think deliberately.” He is a sought-after speaker inspiring over 30,000 people globally. He is an in-demand consultant, presentations and communications coach, and has had over 40 articles published.</p>
<p>He has accelerated success for fast growing companies to the Fortune 50, associations, and government agencies around the world such as ASAE, Charles Schwab, Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, Chinese Association of Science &amp; Technology, Environmental Protection Agency, IBM, Library of Congress, Lockheed Martin, Mexico Ministry of Tourism, Selling Power, SmartCEO Magazine, Turkish American Business Group, University of California, University of Maryland, Warner Bros., and Yum!
