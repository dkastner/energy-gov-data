      <title>Episode 2: The Clean Energy Geek Squad</title>
      <itunes:author>Energy.gov Digital Team</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>We call a &quot;help desk&quot; that provides clean energy policy assistance to governments worldwide, talk to Nicky Phear, who cycles across Montana teaching students about climate change, and propose a few new units of energy -- starting with a burrito.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[ <p>When you have a computer problem, you call tech support. When you have a ghost problem you call Ghostbusters. But who do you call when you have a clean energy problem?</p>
<p>In this episode of Direct Current - An Energy.gov Podcast, Matt calls up the Clean Energy Solutions Center, a "help desk" that provides free expert advice on clean energy policy to governments all over the world.</p>
<p>Allison talks to Nicky Phear, a professor who cycles hundreds of miles across Montana to teach her students about climate change. Nicky just received a big award at the C3E Women in Clean Energy Symposium for her education work, and she's basically an all-around awesome person.</p>
<p>And Dan tries to convince Paul that there is a better way to measure energy -- starting with the humble burrito.</p>

      <title>Episode 3: Power To The People</title>
      <itunes:author>U.S. Department of Energy</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>How does power get to the people who use it?  We explore that question and talk about the electric grid -- what it is, how it works, and what happens when the power goes out.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[ <p>How does power get to the people who use it? In this episode we talk about one of the greatest engineering accomplishments of the 20th century -- something we use every day, but often take for granted: the electric grid. </p>
<p>We talk to an expert about how power travels to our electric sockets, and hear about how one city -- hit with major power outages during Superstorm Sandy in 2012 -- is preparing for the next storm with something called a microgrid.</p>
