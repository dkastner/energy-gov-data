When the contracting officer formally authorizes the contractor to proceed with not yet negotiated work, a not-to-exceed (NTE) value is often established. The NTE is strictly a funding limit, and a contractor is required to observe the limit as the not yet negotiated work is underway.  The full estimate associated with the authorized but not yet negotiated work is reflected as AUW. The budget for the work associated with the NTE may be distributed to control accounts, but the remainder must reside in UB until negotiations are complete and the contract modification is issued.  Some common terminology associated with AUW includes: Change orders (or Unilateral Modifications); Not-To-Exceed which relates to ceiling language within a change order; Undefinitized change orders which is the "status" prior to negotiations; and Definitization which is the conversion of a change order to a bilateral modification. The Total Allocated Budget (TAB) will be equal to, the Negotiated Contract Cost/Price (NCC) plus the value of all Authorized Unpriced Work (AUW), when there are no Over Target Baselines (OTBs).

This contract type specifies a target cost, a target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee adjustment formula. After contract performance, the fee payable to the contractor is determined in accordance with the formula. The formula provides, within limits, for increases in fee above target fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee below target fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the contractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is greater than or less than the range of costs within which the fee-adjustment formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.

The FAR System regulates the activities of government personnel in carrying out that process.  It does not regulate the activities of private parties; however, its requirements may be implemented through contract terms and conditions which define the contractual obligations of those private parties who enter into Government contracts.The FAR is codified in Title 48 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations. It is issued pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-400 and Title 41 of the United States Code), Chapter 7.

Preliminary design provides identification of long-lead procurement items and analysis of risks associated with continued project development and occurs betweenCD-1 and CD-2. (DOE G 413.3-21)3. Preliminary design provides the basis for the detailed design and therefore should have the project design requirements detailed sufficiently to guide the further design, including design requirements and criteria, arrangement diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical one line diagrams, system design descriptions (where applicable), etc. PD is not a percent complete of the design but a fully defined design basis. The trend in DOE projects is to a more complete design before establishing the Performance Baseline, hence a significant portion of the detailed design may be completed prior to CD-2 but this should not be confused with Preliminary Design.
