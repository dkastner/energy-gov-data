But how many of us actually flip off that switch when leaving the room? Tien Nguyen recently retired from the Energy Department&#039;s Fuel Cell Technologies Office after 30 years of federal service. Over the last 16 years, he has saved $200,000 in taxpayer money by simply turning off the lights each night after work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>EERE Success Story—Sowing the Seeds for Improved Home Energy Efficiency in Florida</title>

To overcome this barrier in Florida—where a hot, humid climate can send utility bills soaring when temperatures rise—St. Lucie County used $2.9 million in seed funding from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Better Buildings Neighborhood Program (BBNP) to create the Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF).&lt;/p&gt;

Each District is made up of partnerships between private and public entities in urban areas, bringing together property owners and managers, local governments, businesses, and community stakeholders to improve the performance of the built environment. The private sector has stepped up as a champion for the Districts by uniting invested parties around a shared vision for sustainability and economic growth, while committing to the reduction of energy and water waste within commercial cores.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>EERE Success Story—Aeroseal and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Develop Technology to Find and Fill Building Energy Leaks</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-aeroseal-and-lawrence-berkeley-national-laboratory</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many residential and commercial buildings leak air like sieves, wasting up to 40% of their heating and cooling energy. The primary reason for this energy loss is gaps and holes that exist in buildings’ air ducts. Getting an airtight seal on every connection can be difficult; even with skillful installation and generous applications of mastic (the putty used to seal joints), leakage still occurs. Therefore, most people resign themselves to losing money and enduring uneven temperatures. Mark Modera, an expert in energy performance at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), however, was convinced there had to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
