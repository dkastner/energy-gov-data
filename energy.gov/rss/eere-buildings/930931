 <title>EERE Success Story—Sowing the Seeds for Improved Home Energy Efficiency in Florida</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-sowing-seeds-improved-home-energy-efficiency</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;A common obstacle to accelerating American investment in home energy efficiency is the up-front cost of home energy upgrades and other sustainable improvements. To overcome this barrier in Florida—where a hot, humid climate can send utility bills soaring when temperatures rise—St. Lucie County used $2.9 million in seed funding from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Better Buildings Neighborhood Program (BBNP) to create the Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>EERE Success Story—Aeroseal and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Develop Technology to Find and Fill Building Energy Leaks</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-aeroseal-and-lawrence-berkeley-national-laboratory</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many residential and commercial buildings leak air like sieves, wasting up to 40% of their heating and cooling energy. The primary reason for this energy loss is gaps and holes that exist in buildings’ air ducts. Getting an airtight seal on every connection can be difficult; even with skillful installation and generous applications of mastic (the putty used to seal joints), leakage still occurs. Therefore, most people resign themselves to losing money and enduring uneven temperatures. Mark Modera, an expert in energy performance at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), however, was convinced there had to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the latest Department of Energy (DOE) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.energy.gov/eere/downloads/revolutionnow-2016-update&quot;&gt;Revolution…Now&lt;/a&gt; report, total installation of LED A-type bulbs (the most common type) exceeded 200 million last year, growing 160% over 2014, and now accounting for 6% of all currently installed A-type lamps. That growth has been enabled by a 94% reduction in cost since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

But as scientists learn more about light’s nonvisual effects—such as the role it’s known to play in suppressing the release of melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleep-wake cycle—it’s becoming increasingly clear that light-emitting diode (LED) healthcare lighting offers an opportunity to address more than just visual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>EERE Success Story—New Advanced Refrigeration Technology Provides Clean Energy, Low Utility Bills for Supermarkets</title>

An average supermarket consumes nearly 2 million kilowatt hours per year, and refrigeration accounts for nearly half of that. They are also prone to significant refrigerant leakage—20 to 25% leakage a year of the two to four thousand pound refrigerant inventory—emitting environmentally harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>EERE Success Story—Energy-Efficient Heat Pump for Colder Regions Keeps Residents Cozy with Lower Utility Bills</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-energy-efficient-heat-pump-colder-regions-keeps</link>

&lt;p&gt;Home heating is the largest energy expense for most U.S. homeowners and accounts for nearly 30% of energy used in the nation’s residential buildings. Millions of homeowners in colder regions of the country do not have natural gas available, leaving furnaces to be fueled with heating oil, propane, or electricity. This can often result in higher heating bills for homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

To address this inefficiency, architects, engineers, and home-builders are advocating the use of high-performance windows, which are composed of insulated glass units (IGUs). IGUs lessen unwanted heat gain by combining insulating frames and multiple panes, thin film coatings, and special gas fills between the panes, while selecting for other properties, such as transmittance of visible light and solar heat gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

These heating, ventilation and air conditioning units condition almost half of all U.S. commercial floor space. But commonly they are old and inefficient, wasting anywhere from $900 to $3,700 per unit annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

A low-e coating or glazing is a thin layer deposited directly on the surface of one or more panes of glass. The coating increases the window’s energy efficiency by reflecting radiant heat. Installing a low-e storm window over a low performing window can reduce a home’s heating and cooling costs by 10%–35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

However, conventional refrigerants used in vapor-compression equipment contribute to global climate change when released into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
