Each District is made up of partnerships between private and public entities in urban areas, bringing together property owners and managers, local governments, businesses, and community stakeholders to improve the performance of the built environment. The private sector has stepped up as a champion for the Districts by uniting invested parties around a shared vision for sustainability and economic growth, while committing to the reduction of energy and water waste within commercial cores.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A New Era for Energy Efficiency M&amp;V</title>

But, when you consider that 1-5% of total project costs go to this effort and that $7 billion is spent a year on utility demand side management programs, we see the enormous value of improving our approach to M&amp;amp;V, which could save hundreds of millions of dollars and unleash the potential of smart meters, smart devices and advanced analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;
