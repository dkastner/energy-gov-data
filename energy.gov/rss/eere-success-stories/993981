However, for today’s diesel vehicles to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s tailpipe emissions standards, they use a complex set of emissions controls. Filters that minimize particulate matter are one of the most commonly used forms of emission control systems. Particulate matter can reduce lung function, aggravate asthma, worsen cardiovascular disease, and harm ecosystems,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

These ionic lubricant additives – organic salts that are liquids at ambient temperatures – may also be able to improve durability in addition to vehicle fuel economy. Once commercialized, this technology could be used immediately by drivers to improve fuel economy in their existing cars without needing to purchase a new vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
