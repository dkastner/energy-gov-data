Thus, improving solar cell efficiency is always an important topic for PV researchers. Normally made from silicon, scientists believe that using different materials or a combination of materials could be a major key to boosting energy conversion and improving efficiency in solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The SunShot Initiative’s &lt;a href=&quot;/eere/sunshot/rooftop-solar-challenge&quot;&gt;Rooftop Solar Challenge&lt;/a&gt; funding program is successfully reducing these costs and providing a framework for others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This “Solar Community” initiative began in 2014 and is facilitated by the World Wildlife Fund and managed by Geostellar. It is considered a first-of-its-kind nationwide bulk solar purchase program that expands access to solar energy for participating employees, their families, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
