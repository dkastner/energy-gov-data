Dr. Art Rosenfeld passed away on January 27 at 90 years old. Over the course of a long and incredibly productive career, he left an enormous impact on how our country uses our energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Why Employers Are Hiring Industrial Assessment Center Graduates</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/why-employers-are-hiring-industrial-assessment-center-graduates</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Energy Department&#039;s Industrial Assessment Center program is becoming a hotbed of talent for future employers thanks to the hands-on training it provides. More than 17,000 manufacturers have benefited from Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) assessments. An average assessment leads to a 5-7% implemented energy savings and energy productivity improvement. Through each assessment, IAC students apply their engineering knowledge and skills to analyze a unique set of circumstances. No two assessments are the same, instead students learn how to adapt and solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>5 Ways Cities Can Benefit from SunShot’s Latest Solar Prize Challenge</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/5-ways-cities-can-benefit-sunshot-s-latest-solar-prize-challenge</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solar industry is growing fast. Despite this rapid growth, solar energy remains inaccessible to nearly half of American households and businesses, as well as many local governments and nonprofits. Cities can now go solar through the Solar in Your Community Challenge, a program launched by U.S. Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative to expand solar access to those who have been left out of the growing solar market. Five benefits for cities of this challenge include saving money, job growth, helping low-income residents, improving resiliency, and meeting environmental goals.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Talk to the Panel: Communication and Analytics Help Utilities Scale Up Solar Installations</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/talk-panel-communication-and-analytics-help-utilities-scale-solar-installations</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may come as a surprise to most people: utilities don’t have real-time information about their customers’ electricity usage. When someone adds solar to their home or business, all the utility can see is that the customer’s electricity usage drops; they can’t see how much energy a rooftop solar system offsets energy use. This makes it very challenging for utilities to manage their distribution systems in the most efficient way. The SunShot Initiative is working to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The island is equipped with a solar-diesel hybrid power system that most visitors probably won’t notice. Its 305-kilowatt (kW) solar array sits on top of the main prison building and is hidden from public view to preserve its historical integrity. The solar panels connect to a battery bank and power inverters that help power the island instead of relying solely on diesel generators.&lt;/p&gt;
