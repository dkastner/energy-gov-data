 <title>Report Shows New Transmission Can Help Wind Energy Supply a Third of U.S. Electricity</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/report-shows-new-transmission-can-help-wind-energy-supply-third-us-electricity</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Energy Department today released a report which confirms that adding even limited electricity transmission can significantly reduce the costs of expanding wind energy to supply 35% of U.S. electricity by 2050. The report, titled Reducing Wind Curtailment through Transmission Expansion in a Wind Vision Future and authored by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), affirms the findings of the Energy Department’s 2015 Wind Vision, which showed that a future in which wind provides 20% of U.S. electricity in 2030 and 35% in 2050 is achievable and would provide significant economic, energy security, and health benefits to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Report Shows Potential Growth of Distributed Wind Energy for On-Site Power</title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/eere/articles/new-report-shows-potential-growth-distributed-wind-energy-site-power</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Energy Department today released a first-of-its-kind assessment of the potential future growth of distributed wind energy in the United States through 2050. Distributed wind differs from utility-scale wind in that it is installed at or near the point of end-use to meet on-site demand, such as at a farm, industrial or manufacturing facility, or rural home. The report titled Assessing the Future of Distributed Wind: Opportunities for Behind-the-Meter Projects quantifies the size of the resource as well as the economic and market potential for locally-produced, clean distributed wind energy at homes and businesses nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
