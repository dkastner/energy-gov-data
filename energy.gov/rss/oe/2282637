 <title> Energy Department Announces Approval of Lake Erie Connector Transmission Line </title>
 <link>https://energy.gov/oe/articles/energy-department-announces-approval-lake-erie-connector-transmission-line</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div  property=&quot;content:encoded&quot; class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 12, 2017, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced the issuance of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and Presidential Permit for the Lake Erie Connector Transmission Line. The Lake Erie Connector project is an electric transmission line that would originate in Haldimand County, Ontario, Canada, and terminate in Erie County, Pennsylvania. The project facilities would serve the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland (PJM) Interconnection and would be capable of transmitting up to 1000 megawatts (MW) of renewable hydropower. The project has the potential to provide enough reliable, affordable and carbon-free electricity to serve 810,000 households in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

More than $1.5 million will catalyze new designs of large power transformers (LPTs).  Producing LPTs that are more flexible will help the energy sector better prepare for the sharing and long-term replacement of LPTs in the event of catastrophic failures. This funding will allow corporations, small businesses, and academic institutions in Georgia, Illinois, New York and North Carolina to create new designs that will help produce the next generation of LPTs.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of the E-MAP program is to help states develop holistic approaches to advancing electricity system and related energy infrastructure modernization, resilience, and affordability efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, NASEO announced the selection of the Michigan Energy Office, the Nevada Governor’s Office of Energy, and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy as the pilot states for NASEO’s E-MAP program.&lt;/p&gt;
