The EAC’s recommendations on National Distributed Energy Storage in the Electric Grid also include a general overview of the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) market and technologies and discuss the current status of the DES market, unique benefits and challenges of DES, public policy implications, and the need for codes and standards development. For the purpose of the EAC review, DES is defined as an energy storage element or system located at the distribution substation, within the distribution system, or customer-sited located either behind the customer’s utility revenue meter or customer-sited on the utility side of the revenue meter.&lt;/p&gt;

The Emissions Quantification Tool (EQT), which was conceived of and sponsored by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability and implemented by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) with active engagement from the utility and energy industry, quantifies the direct emissions impacts – positive and negative – of specific planned or installed smart grid projects.  The free, web-based calculator aims to estimate the impact of NOx, SO2 and CO2 emissions on smart grid infrastructure investments, taking into account specific context and project details with a broadly applicable methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

The focus of the study, which was funded in part by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, was to identify the critical areas of mathematical and computational research that must be addressed for the next-generation electric transmission and distribution system. The report also includes a series of recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
