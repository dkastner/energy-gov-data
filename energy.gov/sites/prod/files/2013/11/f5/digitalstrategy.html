	<strong>Describe policy</strong>: DOE is implementing a three-pillar approach -- Transform, Protect and Advance – as part of this broader strategy, to manage the information life cycle. This approach will promote interoperability and openness, as well as drive more secure, cost-effective, and efficient IT infrastructure and services. DOE is transforming its IT architecture to improve our information creation and collection data management processes and to promote system design and release practices to make our information more agile and flexible. As part of this broader effort, the Department is working to consolidate and connect its enterprise networks and services, helping to streamline, simplify, and reduce the cost of IT solutions and acquisition. DOE is working collaboratively within the Department to establish enterprise-wide architecture, policy and standards that give the flexibility to address different devices and platforms and make sure the Department is responding to IT needs quickly and effectively. Finally, DOE has streamlined its IT governance framework to provide more effective management (e.g. DOE Web Council) to develop open standards. The Department will continue to use best practices to safeguard information.

	<strong>Overall Status</strong>: completed<br />
<h3>2.2.1. Publish plan on future activity</h3>
	<strong>Describe policy</strong>: DOE is committed to providing openness and transparency of its data.  The Energy Data Initiative has announced a milestone with the creation of a new resource hub for open energy data, a scalable web portal.

Energy.gov/data includes targeted features for different groups of data customers.  For coders, this resource hub includes featured developer tools such as new Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  There will also be features on popular open datasets and search tools that are valuable for students, regulators, and energy professionals.  Government managers of open data, particularly those that are familiar with the Data.gov platform, will soon take advantage of new “federated search” capabilities by leveraging a growing data catalogue.  Finally, entrepreneurs and job creators will be able to see exactly how open data is fueling economic growth and even contribute their own stories if they so choose.

The new resource hub will continue to grow with the community it supports.  Planned features include improved interoperability with other data platforms like energy.data.gov, openei.org and the National Library of Energy.  There will also be frequent updates from Energy Data Jams leading up to the annual Energy Datapalooza.  The content and capabilities will grow along with a portfolio of “agency.gov/data” sites that will be created by other Federal agencies in the coming months.  Ultimately, the goals of this coordinated effort are to improve our level of customer service for open data as well to empower innovators to create and sustain valuable products that help all Americans.

<hr ><h2>5.3. Evaluate the government-wide contract vehicles in the alternatives analysis for all new mobile-related procurements</h2>
	<strong>Overall Status</strong>: in-progress<br />
	<strong>Describe Implementation</strong>: Driving down costs of mobile devices and services (from IRM Strategic Plan)

DOE is improving usability, availability, and accessibility of services including the optimization of services for mobile use through the Right Path initiative. The RightPath initiative was jointly established by the DOE and NNSA to deliver an efficient and modernized IT infrastructure that enables a virtual workforce where employees may work anywhere, anytime, from any device while enhancing collaboration, business intelligence, and the agency’s cybersecurity posture by combining transformative changes in people, processes, and technology. These capabilities provide for leaner government, improve employee satisfaction and retention, enhance the agency’s cyber security posture, improve energy efficiency, and reduce long-term infrastructure needs for housing employees.

Through RightPath, DOE and NNSA are focusing an enterprise approach on non-differentiated Federal IT. Examples include: core desktop computing, storage, and connectivity provided by datacenters and server rooms; mainframes/servers; telecommunications; desktop systems; mobile devices; email; non-email collaboration tools; identity access and management; corporate cybersecurity services; and web hosting infrastructure.

Details of this effort are listed on page 2 of the DOE PortfolioStat Commodity IT Consolidation Plan v2_091112.
<br />
<h2>6.3. Ensure all new digital services follow digital services and customer experience improvement guidelines</h2>
	<strong>Overall Status</strong>: in-progress<br />
	<strong>Describe Implementation</strong>: The Department is committed to implanting the Federal Digital Strategy and maintaining a digital strategy page 
(http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/digitalstrategy_1.html) to track our progress in establishing those goals. In addition, the Department is at the forefront attaining digital strategy goals. The Department has established energy.gov/data and energy.gov/developer websites to provide easy access to a growing list of data sets, APIs, and other digital tools. The Department is also a full partner in contributing agency energy performance data to the interagency Data.Gov website (http://energy.data.gov). DOE has a Customer Service Plan (http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/DOE_Customer_Service_Plan.pdf)
that outlines our vision for customer service and identifies areas for growth and improvement. For example, Energy.gov has seen a nearly 200 percent increase in traffic since moving to a new open source Drupal-based CMS and migrating nearly all program office sites to the platform. Beyond achieving significant cost savings by reducing duplicative contracts, the consolidation of sites has improved customer service by allowing a single web destination for most public services and information.

DOE evaluates existing and planned customer facing services using our analytics tools and thru our established DOE web council. The Department uses Google analytics and various web based surveys to collect customer feedback. This feedback is used to drive CMS improvements and other web reform.
The Department published its customer service plan at: (http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/DOE_Customer_Service_Plan.pdf)
<br />
<h2>7.2. Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services</h2>
	<strong>Overall Status</strong>: completed<br />
	<strong>Describe Implementation</strong>: Mobile Optimization of Existing Systems (from EMR)

The DOE Office of the CIO is developing a Departmental directive to establish a broad framework of permitted and prohibited mobile technology for federal employees.  The directive will be developed through an Integrated Project Team of subject matter experts from across the DOE federal and contractor community, and will be coordinated through the DOE IT governance process.

The framework will include a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) effort across the federal complex that will change the way DOE works -- empowering employees to do their jobs in a next-generation workspace.  DOE enterprise applications will be supported in all environments regardless of hardware, operating system or location.  DOE has developed a BYOD Toolkit that is both consistent with OMB’s Toolkit and is reflective of DOE’s unique operating environments. The BYOD Toolkit will provides a wealth of data and information that can be used across both our Federal and contractor communities for tailored policies and practices based upon respective missions and consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management strategy. DOE has recently completed the development of enterprise-wide inventory of mobile devices and wireless contracts. The next step is to develop the wireless and mobile policy and implementation plan. <br />
