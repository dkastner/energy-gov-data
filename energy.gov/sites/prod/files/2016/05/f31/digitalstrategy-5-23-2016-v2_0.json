For coders, this resource hub includes featured developer tools such as new Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  There will also be features on popular open datasets and search tools that are valuable for students, regulators, and energy professionals.  Government managers of open data, particularly those that are familiar with the Data.gov platform, will soon take advantage of new \u201cfederated search\u201d capabilities by leveraging a growing data catalogue.  Finally, entrepreneurs and job creators will be able to see exactly how open data is fueling economic growth and even contribute their own stories if they so choose.    The new resource hub will continue to grow with the community it supports.  Planned features include improved interoperability with other data platforms like energy.data.gov, openei.org and the National Library of Energy.  There will also be frequent updates from Energy Data Jams leading up to the annual Energy Datapalooza.  The content and capabilities will grow along with a portfolio of \u201cagency.gov/data\u201d sites that will be created by other Federal agencies in the coming months.

The RightPath initiative was jointly established by the DOE and NNSA to deliver an efficient and modernized IT infrastructure that enables a virtual workforce where employees may work anywhere, anytime, from any device while enhancing collaboration, business intelligence, and the agency\u2019s cybersecurity posture by combining transformative changes in people, processes, and technology. These capabilities provide for leaner government, improve employee satisfaction and retention, enhance the agency\u2019s cyber security posture, improve energy efficiency, and reduce long-term infrastructure needs for housing employees.    Through RightPath, DOE and NNSA are focusing an enterprise approach on non-differentiated Federal IT. Examples include: core desktop computing, storage, and connectivity provided by datacenters and server rooms; mainframes/servers; telecommunications; desktop systems; mobile devices; email; non-email collaboration tools; identity access and management; corporate cybersecurity services; and web hosting infrastructure.    Details of this effort are listed on page 2 of the DOE PortfolioStat Commodity IT Consolidation Plan v2_091112.  "

In addition, the Department is at the forefront attaining digital strategy goals. The Department has established energy.gov/data and energy.gov/developer websites to provide easy access to a growing list of data sets, APIs, and other digital tools. The Department is also a full partner in contributing agency energy performance data to the interagency Data.Gov website (http://energy.data.gov). DOE has a Customer Service Plan (http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/DOE_Customer_Service_Plan.pdf)  that outlines our vision for customer service and identifies areas for growth and improvement. For example, Energy.gov has seen a nearly 200 percent increase in traffic since moving to a new open source Drupal-based CMS and migrating nearly all program office sites to the platform. Beyond achieving significant cost savings by reducing duplicative contracts, the consolidation of sites has improved customer service by allowing a single web destination for most public services and information.    DOE evaluates existing and planned customer facing services using our analytics tools and thru our established DOE web council. The Department uses Google analytics and various web based surveys to collect customer feedback. This feedback is used to drive CMS improvements and other web reform.  The Department published its customer service plan at: (http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/DOE_Customer_Service_Plan.pdf)  "

The framework will include a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) effort across the federal complex that will change the way DOE works -- empowering employees to do their jobs in a next-generation workspace.  DOE enterprise applications will be supported in all environments regardless of hardware, operating system or location.  DOE has developed a BYOD Toolkit that is both consistent with OMB\u2019s Toolkit and is reflective of DOE\u2019s unique operating environments. The BYOD Toolkit will provides a wealth of data and information that can be used across both our Federal and contractor communities for tailored policies and practices based upon respective missions and consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management strategy. DOE has recently completed the development of enterprise-wide inventory of mobile devices and wireless contracts. The next step is to develop the wireless and mobile policy and implementation plan.
