<h1>Digital Government Strategy Report for the Department of Energy</h1>

<h2>2.1. Engage with customers to identify at least two existing major customer-facing services that contain high-value data or content as first-move candidates to make compliant with new open data, content, and web API policy.</h2>
	<strong>Overall Status</strong>: completed<br />
<h3>2.1.1. Paragraph on customer engagement approach</h3>
	<strong>Paragraph on customer engagement approach</strong>: The U.S. Department of Energy will use the DOE Web Council to obtain input on which projects should be selected for the August 23rd deadline. The DOE Web Council is made up from stakeholders across all branches of the complex and the National Labs. This council has expertise that will be invaluable for determining which projects should be prioritized for transparency and impact. We will solicit their feedback via email and / or in person meetings. In addition, we will utilize Energy.gov and it's social media features to solicit input from the public.<br />
<h3>2.1.2. Prioritized list of systems (datasets)</h3>
	<strong>System Name</strong>: ALTERNATIVE FUELING STATION LOCATION DATA - API <br />
	<strong>System Description</strong>: The underlying data used to populate the Alternative Fueling Station Locator tool is available via a Web service. This data set is considered the most trusted industry resource for location-based alternative fueling station data because of the long-standing collection process fostered by relationships with industry and fuel providers and its continuous and rigorous vetting process. Using this API, developers can access the data to build their own mobile apps, widgets, or tools. Developers may choose to mash up the station data set with numerous other data sets available on the Web to create useful products to fill industry-specific needs.  http://developer.nrel.gov/doc/transportation<br />
